## Issue Lifecycle Overview

The LinkedIn content automation system follows a structured lifecycle for each piece of content, from initial idea to published post:

### 1. **Idea Creation** (Issue Opened)
- Create a GitHub issue with your post idea
- Add the `linkedin-post` or `idea` label
- Include any context, key points, or narrative connections
- Issue is automatically added to the GitHub Project board (if configured)

### 2. **Content Generation** (PR Created)
- GitHub Action triggers on label addition
- Claude generates a draft maintaining voice and narrative continuity
- PR is created with the draft content
- Issue is linked to the PR with "Closes #X" syntax
- Project card moves to "In Progress"

### 3. **Review & Refinement** (PR Review)
- Manual review of the generated content
- Edit directly in the PR for improvements
- Claude provides automated feedback on tone and best practices
- Project card in "Review" column

### 4. **Scheduling** (PR Merged)
- Approved content is merged to main branch
- Post is automatically moved to `content/scheduled/`
- Added to schedule.json with optimal posting date
- Project card moves to "Scheduled"
- **Note**: Issue remains open until publication

### 5. **Publishing** (Manual Post)
- Use `/post` command to get today's scheduled content
- Manually copy and post to LinkedIn
- Confirm publication with "posted" response

### 6. **Completion** (Issue Closed)
- Post file moved to `content/published/` with date prefix
- History.md updated with post summary
- Original issue is automatically closed
- Project card moves to "Published/Archive"
- Optional: Add engagement metrics to the closed issue

## GitHub Project Setup

### Why Use a Project?

A GitHub Project provides visual workflow management through a kanban board, offering:
- **Visual Pipeline**: See all content at various stages at a glance
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identify where content gets stuck
- **Metrics Tracking**: Record engagement scores and analyze performance
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple contributors can see the content calendar

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Automatic Setup**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-github-project.sh
   ```

2. **Manual Setup**:
   - Go to your repository ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí New Project
   - Choose "Board" layout
   - Create these columns:
     - üìù Ideas
     - üöß In Progress  
     - üëÄ Review
     - üìÖ Scheduled
     - ‚úÖ Published
     - üìä Archive

3. **Configure Automation**:
   - Auto-add issues with `linkedin-post` label
   - Move cards based on PR status
   - Archive completed items after 30 days

### Custom Fields

Add these fields to track additional metadata:
- **Priority**: High/Normal/Low
- **Content Type**: Story/Tips/Technical/Announcement
- **Scheduled Date**: Target publication date
- **Engagement Score**: Post-publication metrics

## Workflow Automations

### Issue Auto-Close Workflow

Located in `.github/workflows/close-published-issue.yml`, this workflow:
- Triggers when content is published via `/post` command
- Adds publication confirmation to the issue
- Closes the issue with completion status
- Updates project card status

### Project Automation

The `.github/workflows/add-to-project.yml` workflow:
- Automatically adds new issues to the project
- Assigns to appropriate column based on labels
- Updates card status as issue progresses

## Best Practices

### Issue Creation
- **Clear Titles**: Use descriptive titles that summarize the post topic
- **Detailed Context**: Include key points, target audience, and goals
- **Narrative Links**: Reference previous posts for continuity
- **Labels**: Always add `linkedin-post` or `idea` label

### Review Process
- **Voice Check**: Ensure content matches your authentic voice
- **Fact Verification**: Verify any claims or statistics
- **Engagement Optimization**: Check hook strength and CTA clarity
- **Timing Consideration**: Review scheduled date for relevance

### Project Management
- **Regular Reviews**: Weekly review of the content pipeline
- **Metric Tracking**: Record engagement after each post
- **Retrospectives**: Monthly analysis of what content performs best
- **Pipeline Health**: Ensure steady flow, avoid bottlenecks
