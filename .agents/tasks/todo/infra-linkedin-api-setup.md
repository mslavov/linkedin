- Related Tasks: LinkedIn posting automation

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research and document LinkedIn API requirements
- [ ] Create LinkedIn app and obtain API credentials
- [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- [ ] Store access tokens securely in GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Create API client wrapper for posting
- [ ] Implement token refresh mechanism

- Verify rate limit handling
- Test error scenarios and recovery
- Ensure no credential leaks
- Test with expired tokens
