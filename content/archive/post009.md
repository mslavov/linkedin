I recently discovered the **“Masters of Scale”** podcast by **Reid Hoffman** and have been listening almost daily.  The stories of building **LinkedIn, Airbnb, Google and VMware** are both inspiring and instructive.  Each episode reveals how founders think about growth, culture and innovation.  Highly recommended!
