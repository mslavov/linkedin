After automating LinkedIn posts and building a baby monitor for Claude, I hit a new problem â€“ agent anarchy. ðŸ¤–

Picture this: 3 AI coding assistants on the same repo, each following different rules. It's like having three chefs in your kitchen, each cooking from different recipes. Chaos.

**The mess I walked into yesterday:**
â€¢ Claude Code: Following old rules from CLAUDE.md
â€¢ Cursor: Using its own .cursorrules
â€¢ Codeium: Doing... whatever Codeium does

Same PR, three different formatting styles. My git diff looked like a battlefield.

**The stupidly simple fix:**
One folder. Multiple files. Same rules everywhere.

```
/ai-rules/
  â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md
  â”œâ”€â”€ .cursor/rules/CURSOR.md
  â””â”€â”€ AGENTS.md
```

Now they all read from the same playbook:
â€¢ Code style: Consistent across agents
â€¢ Project context: Shared understanding
â€¢ Naming conventions: No more getUser vs fetchUser debates

**The twist?** Each agent's file has the EXACT same content. Yes, I'm duplicating files. No, I don't care. It works.

First PR after implementation: All three agents produced compatible code. Zero conflicts. It's like they finally learned to play nice. ðŸš€

The real lesson? Sometimes the dumbest solution is the smartest. I spent hours researching "AI agent orchestration frameworks" when all I needed was... copy-paste.

Time saved this week: 2 hours of merge conflict resolution.

Have you managed multiple AI agents on the same codebase? What's your coordination strategy?

Next: When your AI agents start having opinions about each other's code...
