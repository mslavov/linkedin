## Original Prompt
I will hold with Agent forge for next week, but today I want to post about non technical topic of being open about not following my 40:40:20 rule of spliting my time. This week has been building 100%. I had a chat with a friend of mine yesterday and he shared this video from Ray Dalio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9XGUpQZY38 where he talks about the 5 steps process improving towards your goals. Long story short it seemed to him I'm not failing enough, i.e. I'm not putting the product into the hands of customers and to be honest he is right. I have this tendancy of doing what I'm good at and what I enjoy the most, but that won't make my startup successful. So here is the plan for next week:
Monday: I will be following up with people I already contacted and trying to find more people to contact. Think about how to do that, one idea is to apply at QA positions :)
Tuesday: I will be going to AI Native Orgs event, where I hope to meet people interested in AI into the workplace, I hope to find potential customers there.

## Core Idea
Honest reflection on breaking my own 40:40:20 rule (build:sell:ai ops - where ai ops = build/improve AI automations to help do more with AI) by spending 100% of time building. A friend's feedback based on Ray Dalio's 5-step process revealed I'm not failing enough - I'm avoiding customer contact because I'm doing what I'm good at rather than what the startup needs.

## Key Points
- Confession: This week was 100% building, not following my own 40:40:20 rule
- Friend's insight: "You're not failing enough" = not getting product in front of customers
- Ray Dalio's 5-step process connection
- The comfort trap: doing what I'm good at vs. what needs to be done
- Specific action plan for next week:
  - Monday: Follow-ups + creative customer hunting (even considering applying to QA positions!)
  - Tuesday: AI Native Orgs event to meet potential customers

## Potential Hook
"This week I broke my own rule. And a friend called me out on it."

OR

"I've been avoiding failure. Which means I'm failing."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Relates to 40:40:20 rule posts (if any exist)
- Continues authentic startup journey narrative
- Shows vulnerability and learning in public
- Contrasts with technical building posts - this is the non-technical reality

## Notes
- Non-technical post focusing on founder psychology and self-awareness
- Ray Dalio video reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9XGUpQZY38
- Creative customer development angle: applying to QA positions to meet potential users
- AI Native Orgs event on Tuesday - good real-world commitment
- This shows the messy reality vs. the polished advice
- Opportunity to discuss "doing what you're good at" trap that many technical founders fall into
