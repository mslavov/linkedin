Three days into "building Bugzy in public" and I've discovered my first problem.

It's not the AI orchestrator platform I started building this week. It's not the customer meetings where I'm trying to convince people why an autonomous QA agent matters. It's this: I have no idea what to share when building in public.

Here's what my week looked like:
• 40% coding (AI agent orchestrator experiments)
• 40% customer conversations (lots of "Bugzy is cool, trust me")
• 20% existential crisis about content strategy

Should I poll you on what you want to see? Just share everything and let engagement metrics decide? Create content pillars and stick to them?

After overanalyzing this (classic engineer move), I realized I'm already organizing my work into three natural buckets:

1. **Product updates**: What I'm building, technical decisions, feature releases
2. **Sales journey**: Customer conversations, rejections, small wins
3. **AI automation insights**: The meta layer - using AI to build an AI business

Instead of forcing a strategy, I'll just share what's actually happening in these three areas. Real work, real struggles, real progress.

Here's the truth - I spent hours strategizing about "authentic" building in public. But maybe that's the most authentic thing I can share: the messy reality of figuring it out as I go.

What aspect of the building journey are you most curious about? Product decisions, customer interactions, or the automation experiments?
