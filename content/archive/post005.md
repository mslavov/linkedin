I rediscovered the importance of **listening** thanks to a TED talk my friend **Mihail Stefanov** shared: [Julian Treasure: 5 ways to listen better](https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_5_ways_to_listen_better).  In the post I reflected on how listening leads to understanding and knowledge.  Good listening helps us improve communication in work and life.
