A month ago, I decided to pivot how Bugzy was built.

This Tuesday, I finally executed it.

Wednesday and Thursday: full-time work on the rebuild.

By Friday: 10 commits, 323 files changed, 16,185 net lines of code.

The rebuild everyone said would take months? Took two days of focused work.

Here's why.

For the past several months, I've been building what looked like the wrong thing - a generic AI agent orchestration platform. While I should have been building Bugzy.

People asked, "Why are you building infrastructure when you should be shipping features?"

Fair question. It felt unfocused. It felt like I was avoiding the real work.

Then Tuesday happened.

I sat down with Claude Code and created a 1,600-line plan to port everything from the generic platform to Bugzy. Wednesday and Thursday I executed that plan.

Platform migration. Slack integration. Invite-only auth. Environment variable management. Security hardening. Agent execution runtime. Git-based file system.

All of it already existed. I just had to make it Bugzy-specific instead of generic.

That "wasteful" foundation work? It became my biggest asset.

16,185 net lines in one week because the foundation was already there. Not building from scratch - reusing, adapting, porting.

The real timeline looked like this:
- Months ago: Started building generic orchestration platform (seemed wrong)
- One month ago: Decided to pivot implementation approach (finally got clarity)
- This Tuesday: Created the detailed migration plan (2 hours)
- Wednesday & Thursday: Executed the rebuild (2 days full-time)
- Friday: Shipping the transformed product

The pivot decision was a month ago. But I couldn't have executed it without all those months of "unfocused" foundation work.

This is the part of startup building nobody talks about. Sometimes you need to build your own tools before you can build your product. Sometimes the "wrong thing" is actually the necessary foundation for the right thing.

The cycle looked wasteful: generic platform → unclear direction → months of infrastructure → finally pivot to product.

But without that cycle, the rebuild would have taken months instead of days.

I'm not saying this was the optimal path. Maybe I should have built Bugzy-specific from day one. Maybe I wasted time on abstractions I didn't need.

But I also shipped 16,185 lines of production-ready code in one week because I had components ready to assemble.

The lesson? Sometimes "wasteful" work isn't waste. Sometimes you're building the foundation you'll need when the right moment comes.

The trick is knowing the difference between necessary foundation and actual procrastination.

I'm still figuring that out.

Have you ever built something that felt like the wrong thing, only to realize it was exactly what you needed later?
