"How are you doing?"

Simple question. Takes a human 2 seconds to answer.

My AI agent? 30 seconds. Because it was treating every Slack message like a formal request requiring full context, complete analysis, and a comprehensive response plan.

That's not a conversation. That's filing a ticket.

Tuesday morning problem: make Bugzy's Slack integration feel responsive. Make it feel human.

The old approach was simple but dumb: every message triggers the main agent with full context. User asks anything, agent gets everything - full conversation history, all available tools, complete project context.

Which is fine when someone asks "run the test suite for the authentication module."

But when they say "hey, how's it going?" you don't need to schedule a research expedition.

The fix: two-tier architecture.

Mini-agent handles the conversational stuff. Quick questions. Status checks. Casual interaction. No need to spin up the full context engine.

Main agent only gets called when there's actual work to do. Testing. Bug analysis. Code investigation.

The difference in UX is massive.

Before: Every interaction felt like waiting for a slow API response.
After: Casual questions get instant responses. Work requests get the full treatment.

It's the same pattern we use for human teams - you don't CC the entire engineering department on "morning, how's everyone doing?"

Making AI agents feel natural isn't about making them smarter. It's about making them know when NOT to overthink.

The goal isn't just functional. It's conversational. It's making people want to interact with the agent instead of dreading the wait time.

How do you balance responsiveness versus thoroughness in your AI interactions?
