I always thought physical exercise is mainly to make your body stronger – and to be honest I never enjoyed it unless there was some thinking involved.  After watching **Marily Oppezzo’s** talk *“Want to be more creative? Go for a walk”* and another talk about the cognitive benefits of exercise, I realized that movement can also be a mental booster.  Now I treat exercise as fuel for creativity and problem‑solving.
