Pushing the boundaries of what’s possible at **PS CoE**!  I shared a blog post by my colleague **Nikolay Andreev** about developing content for **vRO** using **TypeScript**.  It demonstrates how to modernize vRealize Orchestrator plug‑ins by writing them in TypeScript and provides example code.  This is a great example of how our team is using modern languages inside enterprise automation tools.
