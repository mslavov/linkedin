Last week I tried using a personal finance SaaS I built 6 years ago. It still worked, but something felt... antiquated. Not the tech stack â€“ the entire approach.

That's when it clicked: why am I clicking through dashboards when I could just ask questions?

So this week, I built an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects Claude Code directly to bank accounts through Open Banking. Imagine asking your AI assistant: "What did I spend on coffee last month?" or "Can I afford that new server cluster?" and getting instant, contextualized answers.

The technical part? Surprisingly straightforward. Open Banking has matured significantly since my last look 6 years ago. What used to take weeks now takes hours. I can test multiple providers without the integration headaches of the past.

But here's the real question I'm wrestling with: Is there a market for AI-first personal finance insights?

The builder in me says yes â€“ we're replacing static dashboards with dynamic conversations. The skeptic (who's seen plenty of hype cycles) wonders if people actually want their AI reading bank statements.

What's your take? Would you trust an AI with read-only access to your financial data if it meant getting instant, personalized insights? 

P.S. This wasn't even what I planned to work on this week. But sometimes the best projects are the unexpected detours. Stay tuned for the actual reveal soon ðŸš€
