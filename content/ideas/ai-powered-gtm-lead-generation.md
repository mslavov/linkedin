## Original Prompt
While working on my ICP and go to market strategy I actually created a ../go-to-market project which is not yet open source, but it uses Claude Code to scrape potential leads, verify if they are my potential ICPs and adds them to my CRM. Next will be to start messaging them using the Founder led sales approach, first manually of course.

## Core Idea
The 20% AI Ops part of the 40:40:20 rule in action. Instead of manually searching for leads and qualifying them, built a Claude Code-powered system that scrapes potential leads, verifies them against ICP criteria, and populates the CRM automatically. This frees up time for the high-value work: actual founder-led sales conversations. It's meta - using an AI coding tool to automate the grunt work of go-to-market.

## Key Points
- The problem: Finding and qualifying leads is time-consuming but necessary for founder-led sales
- The solution: Built a go-to-market automation project using Claude Code
- What it does:
  - Scrapes potential leads from [sources]
  - Verifies them against ICP criteria (learned from customer conversations)
  - Automatically adds qualified leads to CRM
- The philosophy: Automate the research, keep the relationship-building manual
- Why founder-led sales matters: AI can find leads, but founders close deals through authentic conversations
- The 40:40:20 framework in practice: 20% AI Ops multiplies the effectiveness of 40% Sell
- Next step: Manual outreach to qualified leads (no automated spam)

## Potential Hook
"I spent 20% of my time building an AI tool that does my lead research. Now I spend 40% actually talking to customers instead of searching for them."

or

"Plot twist: I used an AI coding assistant to build my go-to-market engine. Here's what it does..."

or

"Founder-led sales doesn't mean doing everything manually. Here's the part I automated (and the part I'll never automate)."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Perfect example of the 40:40:20 rule: 20% AI Ops enabling better 40% Sell
- Connects to the ICP refinement work from the Bugzy pivot idea
- Shows practical AI application (not hype) - your core philosophy
- Demonstrates "build the tools you need" mentality
- Meta angle: using Claude Code to accelerate customer development
- Builds on "I spent a week on customer conversations" - this tool makes finding those conversations more efficient

## Notes
- HIGH priority - demonstrates the AI Ops framework component you haven't shown much yet
- Dual audience: Founders want to know how to automate GTM, customers see you're serious about finding the right fit
- The "manual outreach" note is important - shows you're not spamming, you're qualifying then personally engaging
- Meta/interesting angle: AI tool helping build AI company's go-to-market
- Could share high-level architecture without open-sourcing the code
- Avoid making it sound too easy - acknowledge the work of defining good ICP criteria first
- The "not yet open source" detail adds intrigue - might become a product later?
- Shows the pragmatic builder mentality: built the tool you needed rather than buying expensive sales automation
- Contrasts nicely with previous posts - shows different aspects of solo founding
- Could mention specific ICP verification criteria (team size, tech stack, pain points)
- Perfect timing: follows naturally from "spent a week defining ICP" story
- Shows you practice what you preach: AI should create leverage, not replace human judgment
