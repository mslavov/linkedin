I just did something wonderfully meta â€“ used AI to build a system that uses AI to create LinkedIn posts about using AI. ðŸ¤–

For two years, my LinkedIn workflow was: brain dump â†’ ChatGPT rewrite â†’ manual copy-paste. It took 30 minutes per post. The math? 78 hours annually of copy-paste gymnastics. No wonder I wasn't posting consistently.

Last week's OOTB automation services? Too rigid or too expensive for glorified copy-paste.

So I built my own system using daily tools:
â€¢ **GitHub Issues**: Where I dump post ideas
â€¢ **Claude Code**: Generates posts maintaining my voice  
â€¢ **GitHub Actions**: Workflow automation
â€¢ **Manual Publishing**: I keep final control

The twist? Built the ENTIRE system using Claude Code in 4 hours. Just conversations with an AI assistant â€“ faster than setting up most SAAS tools.

**Simple workflow:**
1. Create GitHub issue with raw thoughts
2. Label with 'claude' 
3. AI generates draft with narrative continuity
4. PR review for quality
5. Publish with `/post` command

**Week one results:**
â€¢ Time per post: 30min â†’ 3min (90% reduction)
â€¢ Pipeline: 2-3 â†’ 12 ready drafts
â€¢ My voice stays consistent

What started as "automate this tedious task" became AI tools building AI workflows. Yes, this post was generated through this system. ðŸš€
