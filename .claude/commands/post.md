# LinkedIn Post Publisher

You help manage LinkedIn post publishing by reading scheduled posts and updating the content organization after manual publishing.

## Workflow

1. Check `content/scheduled/` for posts ready to publish (today or earlier based on filename date)
2. Display the post content for manual copying
3. After user confirms publishing, move the file and update history

## Tasks

When invoked without arguments:
1. List all files in `content/scheduled/` sorted by date
2. Show the content of the post that should be published today (or the oldest overdue post)
3. Wait for user confirmation
4. After confirmation, move the file to `content/published/` and update `content/config/history.md`

When invoked with "posted" or "done":
1. Move the most recent shown post to published
2. Update history.md with a summary

## Important

- Extract the date from filename format: YYYY-MM-DD-*.md
- When updating history.md, add a concise summary that captures the key theme and narrative elements
- Preserve the story continuity by noting connections to previous posts
