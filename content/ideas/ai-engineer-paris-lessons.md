## Core Idea
Share the most impactful lessons and insights from AI Engineer Paris conference - focusing on unexpected discoveries, emerging trends, and practical takeaways that attendees can apply immediately. Move beyond the obvious keynote highlights to share the corridor conversations and workshop revelations that truly shaped perspectives.

## Key Points
- The gap between AI hype and practical implementation reality
- Emerging patterns in successful AI engineering teams and workflows
- Tools and frameworks gaining real traction vs. those losing momentum
- Network effects: The most valuable connections weren't always the speakers
- Unexpected technical insights from workshop sessions
- European vs. US approaches to AI development and regulation

## Potential Hook
"The best insights at AI Engineer Paris didn't come from the main stage - they came from the debugging session at 2 AM when three engineers figured out why their RAG pipeline kept hallucinating French poetry."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Connects to the published post about attending AI Engineer Paris (2025-09-09)
- Builds on themes of practical AI implementation and real-world engineering challenges
- Can reference the Bugzy announcement if it was made at the conference
- Ties into ongoing narrative about building AI tools and automation

## Conference Day 1 (Sept 23) - Real Experiences

### Key Validation Moment
- Got validation from swyx (AI Engineer co-founder) about my Bugzy approach
- A2C by Zed enables swapping of agents - validates building on top of existing coding agents
- Not a crazy idea after all to layer QA intelligence on existing AI coding infrastructure

### Evals Reality Check
- The struggle with evals is real across the industry
- Decision: Postpone comprehensive eval suite, trust vibes initially
- Once Bugzy is working, then build comprehensive eval suite
- Sometimes shipping beats perfect testing

### Interesting Expo Discoveries

**Alpic**
- Making it easy to deploy MCPs
- KEY INSIGHT: The analytics they provide is the differentiator
- Could be crucial for understanding how Bugzy agents perform in production

**Koyeb**
- High-performance serverless infrastructure
- Not sure if fits my use case (need other services beyond hosting)
- Worth exploring to understand the deployment landscape

**Midio**
- Visual programming language designed specifically for LLMs
- Interesting concept for making agent orchestration more intuitive
- Could inspire Bugzy's workflow design

### Unexpected Connections
- **The Bulgarian moment**: Walking through expo, heard Bulgarian speech
- Met Anton and Stanislav from Cast AI (kubernetes optimization)
- Reminder that tech communities are smaller than we think

- **Data extraction discussion**: Rafael and Thomas
- Covered data extraction challenges, funding landscape, AI implementation
- Real talk about what's working vs. what's hype

## Conference Day 2 (Sept 24) - Validation & Reality Checks

### Talks That Delivered
**Strapy on "Vibes > Benchmarks"**
- Did NOT disappoint - exactly the validation I needed
- Aligns perfectly with my decision to postpone Bugzy evals
- Sometimes product intuition beats metrics obsession
- Ship first, measure later when you know what matters

### Talks That Disappointed
**Graphite Chat**
- They've basically built Claude Code + GitHub Actions
- Nothing revolutionary, just good execution on existing ideas
- Reminder that sometimes "innovation" is just combining existing tools well
- Makes me think Bugzy's differentiation needs to be crystal clear

## Original Notes
- Time-sensitive: Should be published soon after the conference while insights are fresh
- Could include specific tools or techniques discovered at the conference
- Opportunity to highlight connections made and potential collaborations
- Can contrast expectations vs. reality of the conference
- Include actionable takeaways for those who couldn't attend
- Consider mentioning standout presentations or demos that challenged assumptions
