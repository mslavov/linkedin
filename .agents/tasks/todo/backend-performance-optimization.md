# Optimize System Performance

## Context
- PRD: [Initial PRD](../../../docs/product/initial-prd.md)
- Architecture: [LinkedIn Automation Architecture](../../../scratch/linkedin-automation-architecture.md)
- Related Tasks: System optimization for scale

## Subtasks
- [ ] Profile current system performance
- [ ] Optimize Notion sync for large datasets
- [ ] Improve content generation speed
- [ ] Optimize file operations and I/O
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Reduce API call frequency
- [ ] Optimize GitHub Actions runtime
- [ ] Minimize resource usage
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Document optimization results

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Sync time reduced by 50% for large datasets
- [ ] Content generation under 10 seconds
- [ ] GitHub Actions runtime minimized
- [ ] API rate limits never exceeded
- [ ] System handles 1000+ ideas efficiently
- [ ] Resource usage is optimized
- [ ] Performance gains are measured
- [ ] No functionality is compromised

## Technical Notes
- Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Consider parallel processing where safe
- Use caching for repeated operations
- Optimize API batch operations
- Minimize file system operations
- Use efficient data structures

## Testing Requirements
- Benchmark before and after optimization
- Test with various dataset sizes
- Verify functionality unchanged
- Test cache invalidation
- Load test with concurrent operations
- Monitor resource usage
- Test edge cases
