I saw Mo Gawdat's post last week. He's the former Chief Business Officer at Google X, and I respect his AI insights. The post mentioned a 2007 MIT study about how our brains discover answers before our conscious mind catches up.

Fascinating claim. I immediately tried to find the study.

And... couldn't. Anywhere.

Is it real? Misremembered? AI-generated? No idea. And that's exactly the problem we're drowning in - interesting claims everywhere, no easy way to verify them.

So this weekend at a hackathon, five of us (Marto, Deqn, Nikolay, Erik, and I) built Fact-It. A Chrome extension that automatically fact-checks claims in social media posts. Right where you're reading them.

By "we built it," I mean Claude Code did most of the heavy lifting. Five people with the right AI tools can build a working Chrome extension in a weekend. Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini), cross-platform compatibility, real-time checking. All of it.

We came second in the first round of voting. Didn't win overall.

And honestly? That was never the goal.

I went to meet talented people. To see what like-minded builders in Bulgaria are capable of when you give them a problem and the right tools. To validate that AI-assisted development isn't hype - it's how small teams punch way above their weight.

The extension is open source: https://github.com/crossroads-ai-hack-2025/fact-it

What's a problem you've encountered online that made you think "someone should build this"?
