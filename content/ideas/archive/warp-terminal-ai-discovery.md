## Original Prompt
Until 5 mins ago I was: "Why would anyone use Warp?" I used it because it was free in the product pass, like a regular terminal ... but just now I had to figure out why I had 99% storage used on a Raspberry PI. Well I ask Warp and it generated the right commands and it did figure it would suggested how to clean it up and what do so it doesn't happen again. So, I'm sold on Warp now. Anyone else using the AI part of it and can share use cases?

## Core Idea
A genuine conversion story about Warp terminal - went from "using it because it's free" to actually understanding its value when AI assistance solved a real problem (99% storage on Raspberry Pi). Classic developer skepticism meeting practical utility.

## Key Points
- Used Warp passively because it was included in product pass (not for AI features)
- Real problem: 99% storage on Raspberry Pi needed urgent debugging
- Warp AI generated correct diagnostic commands + cleanup suggestions + prevention tips
- Immediate conversion from skeptic to believer
- Opens question to network about their AI terminal use cases

## Potential Hook
"Until 5 minutes ago, I was one of those developers wondering 'Why would anyone use Warp?'"

OR

"I've been using Warp like a regular terminal for weeks. Just regular terminal things. Then my Raspberry Pi hit 99% storage at 5 AM."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Fits the pattern of "practical AI discovery" stories (like Slack MCP, Shelly MCP)
- Early morning timing aligns with 5-6 AM wake schedule
- Raspberry Pi tinkering connects to IoT/smart home interests
- Authentic conversion story without hype
- Developer skepticism â†’ practical value arc

## Narrative Arc
1. **Setup**: Using Warp passively, didn't get the hype
2. **Problem**: Early morning Raspberry Pi storage crisis (99% full)
3. **Discovery**: Asked Warp AI instead of googling
4. **Solution**: Got diagnostic commands, cleanup steps, prevention tips
5. **Conversion**: From skeptic to sold
6. **Community**: Asking network for their AI terminal use cases

## Voice Considerations
- Self-deprecating about being skeptical
- Honest about using tools without exploring features
- Early morning timing feels authentic (5 AM coding)
- Conversational question at the end
- Avoid overselling Warp - keep it genuine

## Engagement Hook
"What's your favorite AI feature in your dev tools that you initially ignored?"

OR

"Anyone else using AI in their terminal? What problems has it actually solved for you?"

## Technical Details to Include
- Raspberry Pi storage debugging scenario
- Warp AI generated multiple types of help (commands + explanation + prevention)
- Real-time problem solving vs. Google search loop

## Potential Concerns
- Could sound like Warp advertisement (counter with genuine skepticism opening)
- Timing: posted right after security review post - provides good variety (discovery vs. infrastructure)
- Check recent posts for similar "I discovered tool X" narratives

## Notes
- Authentic moment of tool discovery
- Fits early-bird persona (5 AM problem)
- IoT/Raspberry Pi aligns with personal interests
- Opens conversation without forcing it
- Good contrast to yesterday's security-focused post
