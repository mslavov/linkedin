3. Content generation needs configuration files
4. Publishing requires approved content workflow
5. All commands needed before testing suite

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Notion and LinkedIn API setups can proceed independently
- Frontend enhancements while backend development
- Documentation can start early and evolve
- Testing framework setup alongside feature development

## Success Metrics
- All PRD requirements implemented
- Fully automated workflow from idea to published post
- Minimal manual intervention (only PR review)
- Comprehensive monitoring and error handling
- Well-documented and tested system

## Next Steps
1. Assign tasks to developers based on expertise
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin with Phase 1 infrastructure tasks
4. Regular sync meetings to track dependencies
5. Continuous testing and documentation updates
