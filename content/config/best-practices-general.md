# LinkedIn Content Best Practices

## Post Structure
1. **Hook** (First 2 lines): 
   - Must grab attention
   - Address a pain point or curiosity
   - Visible before "see more"

2. **Story/Context** (Middle):
   - Personal experience or observation
   - Specific challenge and approach
   - Data or results when available

3. **Insight/Lesson** (End):
   - Key takeaway
   - Actionable advice
   - Question to encourage comments

## Content Types That Perform Well
- **Build in Public Updates**: Share progress, metrics, learnings
- **Failure Stories**: What went wrong and lessons learned  
- **Technical Insights**: Explain complex topics simply
- **Founder Challenges**: Time management, hiring, fundraising
- **Product Decisions**: Why you built X instead of Y
