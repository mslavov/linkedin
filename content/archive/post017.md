We were building **Lofty**, an app to take the guesswork out of furnishing your home.  In this post I asked if anyone in the US was furnishing a house or apartment.  We offered a free living‑room design in exchange for feedback.  Our goal was to improve the furniture shopping experience by showing exactly how pieces will look together in your space.  Interested people could DM me or sign up on our website.
