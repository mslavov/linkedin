# LinkedIn Automation from Notion (Claude-powered)

### TL;DR

Automate the transformation of raw ideas in Notion into polished LinkedIn posts using Claude, GitHub, and smart scheduling. Milko captures insights in Notion, reviews auto-generated drafts as PRs in GitHub, and approved posts are published on LinkedIn at the optimal time. Designed for personal brand building, this workflow saves time, preserves tone, and keeps Milko in control.

## User Stories

**Persona: Milko (Solo Founder, Builder in Public)**

* As Milko, I want to capture ideas in Notion, so they’re not lost and can easily become posts.

* As Milko, I want to review and approve drafts before anything is posted, so I keep control over my personal brand.

* As Milko, I want the system to schedule posts in a smart daily queue, so my audience isn’t overwhelmed or starved for content.

* As Milko, I want my past tone and best-practices to influence post generation, so my content feels authentic.

* As Milko, I want to see edited drafts as PRs, so I can give feedback and approve easily.

## Functional Requirements

* **Notion Sync (Priority: High)**

  * Sync new ideas from Notion database into the GitHub repository as individual markdown (.md) files using MCP server endpoints.

* **Content Generation (Priority: High)**

  * AI agent (Claude) analyzes configuration files (tone.md, history.md, best-practices.md) and generates a draft LinkedIn post in .md format for each idea via MCP server interaction.

* **Review/Approval (Priority: High)**

  * For each draft, automatically create a GitHub Pull Request (PR). Milko reviews, edits, and approves by merging the PR.

* **Scheduling Logic (Priority: Medium)**

  * Maintain a daily posting schedule. Agent can prioritize or reorder the posting queue based on relevance, urgency, or type (e.g., time-sensitive advice vs. evergreen content), all orchestrated through MCP servers.

* **LinkedIn Integration (Priority: Medium)**

  * Post approved drafts to LinkedIn using MCP server endpoints at the scheduled slot.

* **Repository Config (Priority: Medium)**

  * Store tone of voice, best practices, prior posts, and schedule settings in organized markdown files for agent use and easy editing handled via MCP servers.

## User Experience

### Entry Point & First-Time User Experience

* Milko starts by adding raw ideas, thoughts, or links into a designated Notion database. Only essential fields are required for fast entry (e.g., title, optional note/tags).

* A private GitHub repo is prepared with initial configuration files:

  * `tone.md` defining preferred voice and style.

  * `best-practices.md` with content strategies, dos/don'ts.

  * `history.md` providing prior high-performing posts.

  * Config files (.yml, .json) for schedule and agent preferences.

### Core Experience

1. **Idea Capture**

* Milko adds a new idea or update to Notion at any time.

2. **Sync & Draft Generation**

* A scheduled workflow via MCP servers syncs Notion nightly, converting each new idea into a markdown file in a `/ideas` folder.

* The Claude agent reads all contextual .md files (tone, best practices, prior posts) via MCP, and for each new idea, generates a LinkedIn-suitable draft (`/drafts`).

3. **Review as Pull Request**

* Each draft triggers a GitHub Pull Request addressed to `main`, with Milko assigned as the reviewer.

* The PR includes the candidate post, and optional summary/justification (e.g., why it’s positioned in the queue).

4. **Approval Workflow**

* Milko reviews draft, can edit directly in the PR, comment, or reject.

* On merge, the post is approved and enqueued for publishing.

5. **Scheduling & Publishing**

* An automated workflow manages the post queue based on the default cadence (one post daily).

* The agent may reorder the queue if a newly approved post is more urgent or time-sensitive, all managed via MCP servers.

* At the scheduled slot, the draft is posted to LinkedIn via MCP endpoints.

6. **Audit & Feedback**

* Post status, scheduling, and publishing events are recorded as GitHub issues/actions for transparency and troubleshooting.

### Advanced Features & Edge Cases

* **Priority Handling:** If Milko tags an idea as urgent or high-priority, the agent may automatically place it higher in the posting schedule.

* **Queue Management:** The agent regularly reevaluates the queue, ensuring topics don’t bunch up (e.g., not two “tips” in a row) and fresh content gets surfaced.

* **Rejection/Skipping:** Closing a PR (without merging) removes that idea from the posting queue and archives it.

* **API Failure:** If a post to LinkedIn fails, the system retries automatically and creates a GitHub issue with error details.

* **Config Updates:** Adjust tone, best practices, or prior posts at any time by editing the corresponding `.md` files. These changes affect future drafts.

### UI/UX Highlights

* Transparent, auditable workflow—every idea, draft, comment, and approval is visible in GitHub.

* All draft edits and discussions tracked as PR activity.

* Minimal manual steps: single input (Notion) and single approval (GitHub PR) for each post.

* Clear schedule visualization in repo (optional: queue.md auto-generated for review).

## Narrative

Milko, a solo founder determined to grow his company with authenticity and efficiency, constantly captures sparks of inspiration and product updates. Instead of letting these ideas drift away, he tosses them—without friction—into his Notion database. As he sleeps, Claude combs through not only his latest thoughts but also an evolving library of his best posts, favorite tones, and the hard-won wisdom of other public-building founders, all codified in markdown. By morning, his GitHub is alive with new PRs—each thoughtfully composed and positioned for maximum engagement.

With a quick review—sometimes a tweak, sometimes just a nod—Milko merges the PR. Scheduling is stress-free: the agent spaces his insights, surfacing urgent posts or evergreen advice at just the right time, orchestrated smoothly via MCP servers to keep his audience hooked. Each step leaves a clear audit trail. No more “what should I post today?”; the ritual of personal branding becomes a smooth, two-click dance, freeing Milko to spend more time building Bugzy AI, knowing his narrative is always out there, authentic and consistent.

## Success Metrics

### Tracking Plan

* Notion sync event (new ideas fetched via MCP)

* Draft generated event (Claude draft completed via MCP)

* PR opened event (for review)

* PR merged/closed event (approval or rejection)

* Post published event (LinkedIn API confirmation via MCP)

* Queue reorder event (posting schedule adjusted)

---

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

* Notion API integration: fetch new entries, trigger on schedule via MCP

* Claude (or comparable LLM) for draft generation, reading config/best-practice files as context through MCP

* GitHub Actions to orchestrate syncing, file creation, AI calls, and workflow steps using MCP server endpoints

* LinkedIn API integration: authenticate, schedule, post content via MCP

### Integration Points

* **Notion API:** Pull new ideas from personal database via MCP servers

* **GitHub:** Host all configuration, drafts, workflow logic, and audit trail

* **Claude/LLM endpoint:** Generate posts from config/md files + new idea via MCP

* **LinkedIn API:** Automated posting of approved, scheduled drafts via MCP

### Data Storage & Privacy

* All ideas, drafts, configs, and approvals live in a secure, private GitHub repo

* Only approved posts are pushed to external platforms; no sensitive info shared

* Optionally redact or anonymize any references in posts before publishing

### Scalability & Performance

* Supports a daily posting cadence (1-2 posts/day max)

* Efficient queue logic allows backlog growth without performance drop

### Potential Challenges

* Notion API may hit rate limits or experience sync lags

* LinkedIn API outages or unexpected quota restrictions

* Approval bottleneck: if PRs pile up, posting queue could stall

* Properly detecting and handling time-zone shifts, especially for scheduled posts
