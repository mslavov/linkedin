I built the same QA automation tool three times. Each rebuild taught me I was solving the wrong problem.

It started on vacation when I saw someone automating browsers with AI agents. Manual QA seemed like the perfect use case—repetitive, rule-based, time-consuming. So I built a SaaS with fancy onboarding, GitHub integration, Linear tickets, the works.

Then I dropped it.

Not because it didn't work, but because it felt like another over-engineered solution hunting for a problem. Classic senior engineer syndrome, right?

The Conf AI workshop rekindled my interest. This time I'd build in public—accountability through transparency. Version two used browser-use for the automation layer. It could test itself, which felt like magic until I asked it to add more tests.

Complete hallucination festival. The agent started inventing UI elements, creating phantom test scenarios, and confidently asserting things that didn't exist.

The issue wasn't the browser automation—that part worked fine. The problem was context. Without understanding the actual application structure, the agent was essentially testing in the dark.

Version three focused entirely on context engineering. How do humans understand a new codebase? They read docs, explore file structures, understand relationships between components. Coding agents already do this brilliantly.

That's when it clicked: I didn't need to build a new QA framework. I needed to give existing AI agents the right context and tools.

Now I'm rebuilding Bugsy on Claude Code. No fancy SaaS features yet—just the core engine running on my laptop. I'm testing it against real projects, fine-tuning prompts, and discovering edge cases before even thinking about cloud deployment.

The lesson? Sometimes you need to build the wrong thing three times to understand what the right thing actually is. The fancy UI and integrations were distractions. The real challenge was teaching an AI to understand context the way a QA engineer would.

Currently running tests locally, breaking things, fixing them, repeat. Once the core is solid, then we'll talk about making it pretty.

What's the longest you've worked on solving the wrong problem before finding the right one?
