I said I'd spend 40% of my time on sales. Here's what Monday and Tuesday actually looked like.

Monday morning: scraped 37 QA positions from LinkedIn. Found 8 companies where I could ask for a warm intro. The other 29? Still sitting in my "cold outreach" list because I keep finding reasons not to send them.

Afternoon: Two things happened. First, kicked off the first official Bugzy pilot. 4-6 weeks, clear metric - find the same bugs their QA team would catch, no false positives. Second, had a discovery call that felt perfect. Great fit, they're interested, want to see a demo. Then: "Let's revisit this when it becomes a priority for us."

Not a no. Just... not now.

Tuesday: attended a local AI masterclass event. Whole day. Reconnected with people I knew, met new faces, got 2 leads worth following up on.

That's it. That's the recap.

Two days of "selling" and here's what I'm sitting with:

One pilot running. One "let's talk when it's a priority" from a good prospect. 8 warm intro opportunities I need to actually ask for. 29 cold emails still not sent because every time I sit down to write them, I think "this feels wrong" and go back to building instead. 2 new leads from Tuesday's event.

I'm not sure what I expected. Maybe clearer yes/no answers? Maybe more momentum?

What I got was a reminder that "great fit" doesn't mean "ready to buy," and that the comfortable parts of selling (scraping, warm intros) aren't the parts that actually move things forward.

Next week: following up on those 8 warm intros. And maybe, finally, sending one of those damn cold emails.

What's harder for you - doing the uncomfortable sales work, or admitting which parts you keep avoiding?
