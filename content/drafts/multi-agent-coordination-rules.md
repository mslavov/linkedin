After automating LinkedIn posts and building a baby monitor for Claude, I hit a new problem â€“ agent anarchy. ðŸ¤–

Picture this: 3 AI coding assistants on the same repo, each following different rules. It's like having three chefs in your kitchen, each cooking from different recipes. Chaos.

**Why I needed this:**
I wanted to test different AI agents on the same codebase â€“ see which one works best for different tasks. But without shared rules?
â€¢ Claude Code: Following its own CLAUDE.md
â€¢ Cursor: Using .cursorrules
â€¢ Codeium: Doing... whatever Codeium does

Same PR, three different formatting styles. My git diff looked like a battlefield.

**The stupidly simple fix:**
One folder. Multiple files. Same rules everywhere.

```
/ai-rules/
  â”œâ”€â”€ package-manager.md
  â”œâ”€â”€ code-style.md
  â”œâ”€â”€ testing-approach.md
  â””â”€â”€ project-context.md
```

Now they all read from the same playbook:
â€¢ Code style: Consistent across agents
â€¢ Project context: Shared understanding
â€¢ Naming conventions: No more getUser vs fetchUser debates

**The beauty?** Minimal duplication. Each agent's config just points to these shared rules. Once set up, it rarely changes â€“ only when you switch your AI workflow.

Now I can switch between agents as I feel like it. Testing Claude for complex refactoring? Done. Trying Cursor for quick edits? Easy. All three agents produce compatible code. Zero conflicts. ðŸš€

The real lesson? Sometimes the dumbest solution is the smartest. I spent hours researching "AI agent orchestration frameworks" when all I needed was... copy-paste.

The real win? Freedom to choose the right tool for each task without worrying about consistency.

Have you managed multiple AI agents on the same codebase? What's your coordination strategy?
