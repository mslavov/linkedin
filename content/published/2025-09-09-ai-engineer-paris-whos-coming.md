The agenda just dropped for AI Engineer Paris (Sept 23-24), and I'm getting that pre-conference feeling â€“ equal parts excitement and "how will I possibly catch everything?"

Station F, 700+ AI engineers, single-track technical talks. After years of "AI will change everything" keynotes, I'm ready for the "here's how we actually built this" conversations.

**What I'm most excited about:**

Pierre Burgy (Strapi CEO) is presenting "Vibe > Benchmarks" â€“ basically saying what we're all thinking: benchmark scores rarely translate to user value. He's building "vibe benchmarks" based on actual usage patterns. Finally, someone measuring what matters.

The Spotify folks are showing how they're using LLMs for continuous code migrations across thousands of repos. Not just a POC â€“ actual production rewrites, all the time.

Also catching:
â€¢ Docker's multi-agent systems workshop - from solo AI to collaborative teams
â€¢ Martin Woodward on building MCPs at GitHub scale
â€¢ Aparna Dhinakaran on system prompt learning for agents

The expo floor is where the real conversations happen though. Always.

If you're going, let's connect! I'll be the one asking annoyingly specific questions about context windows and token optimization. â˜•

Planning to attend? What talks are you targeting?

And if you're presenting â€“ absolutely want to catch your talk. Drop a comment so I don't miss it.

See you at Station F! ðŸš€
