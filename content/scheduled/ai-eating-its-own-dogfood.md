So I just did something wonderfully meta â€“ I used AI to build a system that uses AI to create LinkedIn posts about using AI. ðŸ¤–

Here's the confession: For the past two years, my LinkedIn posts have been heavily AI-assisted. My workflow? Brain dump my thoughts â†’ ChatGPT rewrites them so humans can understand â†’ Manual copy-paste to LinkedIn. It worked, but it felt... inefficient.

The math on regular posting was daunting: 30 minutes per post Ã— 3 posts per week = 1.5 hours of copy-paste gymnastics. If I actually kept that pace for a year? That would be 78 hours of mind-numbing manual work. No wonder I wasn't posting consistently.

Last week I looked at all the OOTB automation services. They were either too rigid or too expensive for what's essentially a glorified copy-paste operation.

Today I decided to scratch my own itch using the tools I use daily:

â€¢ **GitHub Issues**: Where I dump my post ideas (just like code tasks)
â€¢ **Claude Code**: To generate posts that maintain my voice 
â€¢ **GitHub Actions**: For the workflow automation
â€¢ **Manual Publishing**: Because I still want final control

The twist? The ENTIRE system was built using Claude Code in just 4 hours. No manual coding â€“ just conversations with an AI assistant that understands both code and context. That's faster than setting up most SAAS tools.

**The workflow is simple:**
1. Create a GitHub issue with my raw thoughts
2. Label it with 'claude' 
3. Claude generates a draft maintaining narrative continuity
4. PR review for quality control
5. Manual publish with the `/post` command

**The results after one week:**
â€¢ Time per post: 30 minutes â†’ 3 minutes (90% reduction)
â€¢ Posts in pipeline: went from 2-3 â†’ 12 ready drafts
â€¢ Consistency score: my voice variance dropped by 60%
â€¢ Coffee consumed while waiting: 0 cups (down from 3)

What started as "I should automate this tedious task" became an exploration of AI tools building AI workflows. And yes, this very post you're reading was generated through this system. ðŸš€

For my fellow developers: Have you automated any of your content workflows? What tools are you using?

For founders: How do you balance automation with authenticity in your content?
