Remember when I discovered Claude Code works best with small, focused tasks instead of grand master plans? Well, here's the next chapter in that story.

I've been building automation workflows since my vRO days at VMware (RIP, old friend ðŸ«¡). These days, whenever I think "I need to automate this," my brain goes in two directions:

**Option 1: Traditional Automation** 
Set up n8n/Zapier/Make with predefined steps. Email â†’ Summary â†’ Slack. Click, drag, test, deploy. Done.

**Option 2: AI Agent with MCP Tools**
Write plain English instructions. Let Claude Code figure out the implementation. "When I get an email about a deployment, summarize it and notify the team."

Here's what I've learned after trying both approaches:

Traditional tools win when:
â€¢ You need 100% predictable execution
â€¢ The workflow rarely changes
â€¢ You're dealing with sensitive data
â€¢ Cost per execution matters

AI agents shine when:
â€¢ Requirements keep evolving
â€¢ You need intelligent decision-making
â€¢ The workflow has many edge cases
â€¢ You value development speed over runtime cost

The plot twist? I'm using BOTH. Traditional automation for the boring, reliable stuff. AI agents for the complex, thinking stuff.

And yes, I'm basically getting enterprise-grade automation for "free" with my Claude subscription. Until they change the pricing. Which they will. Because they always do. ðŸ˜…

What's your take? Are you replacing your automation tools with AI agents, or finding the sweet spot between both?
