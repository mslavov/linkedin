# Placeholder Post - To Be Written

## Topic: Conference Technical Deep-Dive (Pillar 2 - Building with AI Systems)

### Potential angles to explore:
- Deep technical insight from a specific workshop or talk
- Comparison of different AI agent architectures discussed
- The MCP ecosystem evolution - what's actually being built?
- European vs US approaches to AI development (from conversations)
- Tool/framework deep-dive from expo floor discoveries
- The "building on giants" theme - who's actually innovating vs. wrapping?

### Specific topics from conference:
- Alpic's MCP analytics approach - why this matters
- The eval struggle across the industry - common patterns
- Agent swapping architectures (A2C by Zed)
- Visual programming for LLMs (Midio)
- What Graphite Chat reveals about the "innovation" landscape

### Connection points:
- Build on Friday's conference post (personal takeaways)
- Connect to Bugzy's technical architecture decisions
- Reference the "vibes > benchmarks" philosophy
- Show how conference insights influence product direction

### Tone guidelines:
- Technical but accessible
- Focus on "why this matters" not just "what was said"
- Include specific examples and code concepts
- Challenge conventional wisdom if appropriate
