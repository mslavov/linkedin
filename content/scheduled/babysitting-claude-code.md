Remember my post about automating LinkedIn posts with AI? Plot twist ‚Äì AI assistants need babysitting too. üë∂

Claude Code is brilliant, but it's like leaving a toddler with your codebase. Walk away for coffee, come back, and it's sitting there: "Can I delete this folder? Pretty please?"

After finding Claude waiting patiently for hours (multiple times), I built what any reasonable developer would ‚Äì a baby monitor for my AI assistant. üçº

**The damage from missed prompts:**
‚Ä¢ 7 stalled workflows (2.5-hour average wait)
‚Ä¢ 3 timeout failures requiring complete reruns
‚Ä¢ 14 emergency Claude check-ins

**The hilariously simple fix:**
Claude Code has event hooks ‚Üí Bash script ‚Üí Pushcut ‚Üí iOS notifications. Now my phone buzzes whenever Claude needs attention.

**Results after one week:**
‚Ä¢ Response time: 2.5 hours ‚Üí 3 minutes
‚Ä¢ Success rate: 73% ‚Üí 96%
‚Ä¢ Setup time: 15 minutes (ROI in 2 days)

The irony? I'm now more responsive to my AI than actual notifications. Just like a real baby, Claude always needs something the moment you step away. ‚è±Ô∏è

This month: 47 notifications = 47 times Claude would've been waiting = 4 hours saved.

Have you built any "quality of life" tools around AI assistants? What's your most creative workaround?
