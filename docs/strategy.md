# Content Strategy for Building Bugsy in Public

## Current Situation Analysis

### Where You Are Now
- **Announcement made**: Sept 16th - Building Bugsy in public with AI as co-founder
- **Pipeline status**: No scheduled posts currently
- **Ready content**: 1 draft about Bugsy journey ("Three Builds, One Lesson")
- **Ideas backlog**: 4 topics (AI Engineer lessons, business-as-code, CLI evals, startup focus)
- **Recent focus**: Heavy emphasis on AI tools and Claude Code
- **This week's progress**: Building AI orchestration platform, design partnership meetings

## Proposed Content Pillars & Experiments

### Pillar 1: Bugsy Product Journey (Weekly)
**Purpose**: Share the real journey of building Bugsy, from technical challenges to customer insights

**Structure**: Problem → Solution → Learning format

**Potential Topics**:
- Week 1: "Three Builds, One Lesson" (draft ready)
- Week 2: Design partnerships - what I'm learning from early conversations
- Week 3: Building an AI orchestration platform (90% component reuse)
- Week 4: First customer feedback and pivots
- Future: Context engineering breakthroughs, QA agent evolution, scaling challenges

### Pillar 2: Building with AI Systems (Bi-weekly)
**Purpose**: Technical deep-dives on AI agent workflows and automation

**Structure**: Challenge → Implementation → Code snippets/GitHub links

**Potential Topics**:
- Business-as-code: Running everything through GitHub and Claude Code
- AI agent orchestration patterns from real use cases
- Context engineering for QA agents - what actually works
- Automation workflows that deliver value vs. complexity
- Building libraries for the community

### Pillar 3: Transparent Founder Updates (Monthly)
**Purpose**: Share real metrics and lessons without exposing customers

**Structure**: Numbers → Insights → Questions for community

**Potential Topics**:
- Monthly metrics: revenue, customers, time allocation
- Sales process learnings (engineer learning to sell)
- Time allocation experiments (current 40/40/20 split)
- Design partnership outcomes and learnings
- What's working vs. what's not

### Pillar 4: Community Contributions (As needed)
**Purpose**: Give back through open source tools and learnings

**Structure**: Problem → Solution → GitHub link

**Potential Topics**:
- Small libraries built for Bugsy that others can use
- MCP servers and tools
- AI workflow templates
- Code snippets and patterns

## Implementation Structure

### Content Calendar Approach
- **Monday**: Bugsy product update (Pillar 1)
- **Wednesday**: Technical deep-dive (Pillar 2, alternating weeks)
- **Friday**: Community/open source (Pillar 4, when available)
- **Monthly**: Founder transparency report (Pillar 3, first Monday of month)

### Content Production Workflow
1. Use existing GitHub Issues → PR → Schedule system
2. Batch create 4-6 posts on weekends
3. Maintain 1-week buffer in scheduled folder
4. Use Claude to maintain narrative continuity
5. Review and publish manually via `/post` command

## Experiments to Run

### Experiment A: "Building Log" Format
- **What**: Daily bullets of what you built/learned
- **How**: Keep running log, synthesize weekly into post
- **Duration**: Test for 2 weeks
- **Measure**: Engagement vs. effort ratio

### Experiment B: "Problem of the Week"
- **What**: Share one specific challenge you're solving
- **How**: Post problem Monday, solution Friday
- **Duration**: Test for 3 weeks
- **Measure**: Community input quality and engagement

### Experiment C: "Behind the Metrics"
- **What**: Share one business metric weekly
- **How**: Number + context + learning
- **Duration**: Test for 1 month
- **Measure**: Comfort level with transparency, audience response

## Immediate Actions Checklist

- [ ] Schedule existing "Three Builds, One Lesson" draft
- [ ] Create content templates for each pillar
- [ ] Set up simple tracking for post performance
- [ ] Batch create 4 posts this weekend (1 per pillar)
- [ ] Update memory.md with Bugsy focus and content pillars
- [ ] Create GitHub issue template for quick Bugsy learning capture
- [ ] Define customer privacy boundaries document

## Success Metrics

### Consistency Metrics
- Target: 3-4 posts/week maintained
- Buffer: Always have 1 week scheduled ahead
- Streak: Track consecutive weeks of posting

### Engagement Metrics
- Track which pillars perform best
- Monitor discussion quality in comments
- Note which topics generate DMs/connections

### Efficiency Metrics
- Time spent: < 2 hours/week on content creation
- Batch efficiency: Posts created per session
- Automation usage: % of content through GitHub workflow

### Business Impact Metrics
- Design partnerships from posts
- Inbound interest correlation with content
- Community feedback influencing product

## Risk Mitigation

### Customer Privacy
- Never mention customer names without explicit permission
- Anonymize all customer stories and examples
- Focus on learnings, not specific client details

### Over-sharing Boundaries
- No sensitive revenue numbers until comfortable
- No competitor criticism or comparisons
- No internal struggles that could concern customers

### Time Management
- Strict 2-hour weekly limit on content
- Use batching to improve efficiency
- Leverage existing automation fully

### Content Quality
- Maintain authentic voice (tone.md)
- Continue story threading from previous posts
- Always provide value, not just updates

## Content Ideas Already in Pipeline

1. **Bugsy Journey** - The three builds story (draft ready)
2. **AI Engineer Paris Lessons** - Conference takeaways
3. **Business as Code** - Running company through GitHub
4. **CLI Evals Comparison** - Technical comparison post
5. **Startup Focus Struggle** - Honest founder challenge

## Notes for Implementation

- Start small: Pick 2 pillars to begin
- Iterate weekly based on what's working
- Don't force content if nothing valuable to share
- Use your actual work as content source
- Remember: Transparency builds trust, but boundaries matter

## Review Schedule

- Week 2: Assess experiment results
- Week 4: Full strategy review and adjustment
- Month 2: Decide on long-term structure
