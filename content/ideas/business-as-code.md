## Original Prompt
Since I started thinking about how to organize my work with the help of AI. I first created the LinkedIn post automation, which works in Github with Claude Code. Then I thought why not run my company as a GitHub repo handling all different kinds of tasks. But then when I thought about AI workflow/agent orchestration platform, building agents and running my company on that sounded even better. Luckily it reuses a lot of the components I have already built for Bugzy, so I console myself that while working on the company itself, I'm still working on the startup. That is why I spent 3 whole days working on it last week.

## Core Idea
The journey from automating LinkedIn posts with GitHub + Claude Code to envisioning the entire business running on an AI agent orchestration platform - and how building the internal tools actually advances the product.

## Key Points
- Started with LinkedIn automation (GitHub + Claude Code)
- Evolved to "business as code" concept (everything in GitHub)
- Realized agent orchestration platform is the better solution
- Building internal tools = building Bugzy components
- Spent 3 days last week implementing this vision
- The meta aspect: using the startup product to run the startup itself

## Potential Hook
"I started by automating my LinkedIn posts. Now I'm running my entire company on the AI agent platform I'm building. Best part? Every internal tool I create becomes a feature for my customers."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Builds on successful LinkedIn automation project
- Evolution of thinking about AI in business operations
- Connects to Bugzy development narrative
- Shows practical application of "dogfooding" principle
- Continues the "building in public" narrative with real examples

## Notes
- Emphasize the progression: simple automation → GitHub workflows → agent orchestration
- Highlight the efficiency of dual-purpose development (internal tools = product features)
- Could show specific examples of agents/workflows created
- Address how this validates the product-market fit
- The 3-day deep dive shows commitment to the vision
