Remember the 40:40:20 rule I've been following? 40% Build, 40% Sell, 20% AI Ops?

Here's what the 20% looks like in practice.

While defining my ICP and running those 30 customer conversations, I built something I'm calling my go-to-market engine.

Not open source (yet). Just a private project using Claude Code to:

1. Scrape potential leads from various sources
2. Verify them against my ICP criteria (learned from those customer calls)
3. Automatically add qualified leads to my CRM

The philosophy: automate the research, keep the relationship-building manual.

Because here's the thing about founder-led sales - AI can find the leads, but founders close deals through authentic conversations.

I'm not automating the outreach. That stays personal. Manual. One conversation at a time.

What I'm automating: the hours of searching, filtering, and qualifying that used to eat my mornings.

The result: I spend 20% of my time building tools that make my 40% Sell time actually productive.

Before: 2 hours finding leads, 1 hour talking to them
Now: 10 minutes reviewing qualified leads, 3 hours having real conversations

The meta part: using an AI coding assistant (Claude Code) to build the go-to-market engine for an AI product.

It's not perfect. The ICP criteria needed three iterations. The scraping logic breaks when sources change their structure. But it works.

And it freed up time to have the conversations that led to Bugzy's pivot.

That's the 20% AI Ops in action: build the automation that multiplies the effectiveness of everything else.

No fancy sales automation platform. No $10k/month tools. Just Claude Code, a weekend, and a clear understanding of what actually needs automating.

Next up: manually reaching out to these qualified leads. Because that part? That's where the real work happens.

What parts of your GTM have you automated? What parts will you never automate?
