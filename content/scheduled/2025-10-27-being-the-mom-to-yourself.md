Thursday. My friend checks in on me.

"How's it going with the pilots?"

I'm feeling good. "Great! Three pilots running. People are really interested."

He pauses. "How do you know what you're building for them will turn into a product and not three custom solutions?"

"Oh, I'm abstracting everything. I'm not building custom solutions - I'm using the product. So technically it is a product."

He mentions The Mom Test. Third person in two months.

I know what The Mom Test says. I've read summaries. I get the concept. But this feels different.

So I open Claude. Get it into interrogation mode. Then spend an hour trying to argue my point of view.

"I know what you're talking about, but this is different."

Claude doesn't budge:

"Okay, I'm going to be direct because I think you already know the answer: Yes, you're being the mom to yourself."

Ouch.

Friday, I decide to test it. In customer meetings, I'll actually follow Claude's advice. Ask the hard questions. Listen instead of explaining. Stop the "oh yeah, I know what you're talking about" reflex that kills real learning.

I failed spectacularly.

Every time someone mentioned a problem, my brain went: "Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about." And I'd start explaining my solution instead of digging deeper into their problem.

The knowing trap is real. I know The Mom Test principles. I know I should ask about past behavior not future promises. I know I should shut up and listen.

But knowing and doing are completely different skills.

So I'm taking inventory:
- 30 cold leads in my pipeline
- Only 2 actually fit my ICP when I'm honest about it
- Need to learn how to message strangers without sounding like a robot
- Need to learn how to actually shut up in discovery calls

The real irony? I've preached customer development at every CTO roles I've had. It was easy to give that advice when I wasn't the one doing the calls.

Now I'm the one failing at what I was preaching.

This week's focus: having 5 real discovery calls where I ask more questions than I answer. Where I don't jump to "oh yeah, I know" every 30 seconds.

And maybe actually reading The Mom Test instead of assuming I already know what it says.

What advice do you know but struggle to actually follow?
