You know that feeling when you're testing 3 different AI coding assistants and realize you're copy-pasting the same rules into CLAUDE.md, .cursor/rules, and AGENTS.md? I just solved this in the most obvious way possible. ðŸŽ¯

Here's the mess: Each AI tool wants its special rules file. Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md. Cursor needs .cursor/rules. Codex has its own setup. Maintaining consistency? 27 copy-paste operations last week alone.

**My stupidly simple fix:**
1. Created `.rules/` folder with all common guidelines
2. Replaced each AI's rule file with: "Hey, go read .rules/ first"
3. Done. Single source of truth.

It's like giving all your cats the same feeding schedule â€“ they might complain, but at least they're consistent.

**Before:**
â€¢ 3 rule files Ã— 5 updates = 15 edits
â€¢ Inevitable drift between versions
â€¢ "Wait, which AI knows about our logging standards?"

**After:**
â€¢ Update once in .rules/
â€¢ All AIs follow same patterns
â€¢ Zero confusion about conventions

The real win? Testing different AI assistants on the same codebase now gives comparable results. No more "Claude reformatted everything because Cursor uses different rules."

This joins my growing collection of "why didn't I do this sooner" moments â€“ right next to automating LinkedIn posts with AI and building a baby monitor for Claude.

Have you standardized your AI assistant setup? Or are you still living in copy-paste chaos like I was?
