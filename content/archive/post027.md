**It’s interesting that many of the same things that make software easier for people to work with also make it easier for LLM coding agents to work with.**

In this short post I reflected on lessons from using large‑language‑model coding assistants.  The key points were:

- Take **small steps** – incremental changes are easier to review and revert.
- Maintain **smaller, simpler codebases** with less context to keep track of.
- Get **fast feedback** via tests and checks that quickly disqualify problematic changes.

These principles improve developer productivity and also help AI tools produce better code.
