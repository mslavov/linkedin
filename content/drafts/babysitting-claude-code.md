Remember my post about using AI to automate LinkedIn posts? Well, plot twist ‚Äì turns out AI assistants need babysitting too. üë∂

Here's what nobody tells you about Claude Code: it's brilliant, but it's also like leaving a toddler alone with your codebase. You walk away for a coffee, come back, and it's sitting there asking "Can I delete this folder? Can I run this command? Pretty please?"

After missing several permission prompts (and finding Claude patiently waiting for hours), I realized I needed a notification system. So I built what any reasonable developer would build ‚Äì a baby monitor for my AI assistant. üçº

**The solution was hilariously simple:**
1. Claude Code has hooks for events (like notifications)
2. I wrote a bash script that parses these events
3. Connected it to Pushcut for iOS push notifications
4. Now my phone buzzes whenever Claude needs attention

Here's the actual script for my fellow Claude parents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
json_input=$(cat)
message=$(echo "$json_input" | jq -r '.message // "No message"')
cwd=$(echo "$json_input" | jq -r '.cwd // ""')
dir_name=$(basename "$cwd")
escaped_message=$(echo "$message" | jq -Rs .)

curl -X POST -d "{\"text\": $escaped_message, \"title\": \"Claude needs you\"}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.pushcut.io/<YOUR_SECRET>/notifications/Claude%20needs%20you
```

The irony? I'm now more responsive to my AI assistant than my actual notifications. And yes, just like a real baby, Claude always seems to need something the moment you step away. ‚è±Ô∏è

**For developers:** Have you built any "quality of life" tools around AI assistants? What's your most creative workaround?

**For founders:** How do you balance automation efficiency with the overhead of managing the automation itself?
