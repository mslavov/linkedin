After watching **Ricardo Semler’s** talk *“How to run a company with (almost) no rules,”* I shared some takeaways:

- Giving up control and trusting people can be good for business; it empowers employees to act like owners.
- Radical transparency and open decision‑making make organisations more resilient.
- Rules and bureaucracy often get in the way of innovation; focusing on principles helps teams adapt.

This talk made me reflect on how we structure teams and build culture.
