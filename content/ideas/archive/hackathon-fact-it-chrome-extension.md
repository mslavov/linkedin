## Original Prompt
This weekend I went to a hackathon we (me, Marto, Deqn, Nikolay and Erik) build fact-it a fact checking chrome extension to check information you see on social media. By we I mean Claude Code of course. Here is the demo script:

[Full demo script included showing the Mo Gawdat post example and Fact-It solution]

We were second after the first round of voting, but at the end we didn't win. But that was not my goal anyway, I wanted to meet great people and I did, I wanted to see what like minded people in Bulgaria are capable of.

## Core Idea
A hackathon story that showcases the practical power of AI-assisted development (Claude Code) while highlighting the real value of hackathons: not winning, but connecting with talented people and proving what's possible when you have the right tools and team.

## Key Points
- **The Problem**: Real frustration with verifying claims on social media (Mo Gawdat example is perfect and relatable)
- **The Team**: 5 people building together with Claude Code doing the heavy lifting
- **The Product**: Fact-It - Chrome extension that automatically fact-checks social media posts
  - Works across platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook)
  - Supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
  - Manual or automatic checking modes
- **The Outcome**: Second in first round, didn't win overall - but that wasn't the point
- **The Real Win**: Meeting capable, like-minded builders in Bulgaria's tech scene

## Potential Hook
Option 1: "I spent my weekend at a hackathon. We built a Chrome extension to fact-check social media. By 'we,' I mean me, four talented engineers, and Claude Code."

Option 2: "Mo Gawdat's post about a 2007 MIT study fascinated me. Then I tried to verify it and couldn't find it anywhere. That's the exact problem we solved this weekend at a hackathon."

Option 3: "We didn't win the hackathon. And I'm perfectly fine with that. Here's what I actually got from spending my weekend building with strangers..."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Ties into 40:40:20 rule - the 20% AI Ops investment enabling rapid prototyping
- Demonstrates AI as practical tool (not hype) - Claude Code as co-builder
- Aligns with "building in public" and transparent sharing of experiences
- Shows dual CTO still writes code and participates in community events
- Bulgaria tech community focus (similar to VMware Bulgaria references)

## Narrative Angles
1. **AI-assisted development story**: Show how Claude Code enabled 5 people to build a working Chrome extension in a weekend
2. **Problem-solution narrative**: Lead with Mo Gawdat frustration, then reveal Fact-It solution
3. **Redefining success**: Challenge the "winning is everything" hackathon mindset - focus on connections and capabilities
4. **Bulgaria tech scene**: Highlight the quality of local talent and community

## Technical Details to Include (if relevant)
- Chrome extension architecture
- Multi-provider AI integration (shows technical sophistication)
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Real-time fact-checking capability

## Potential CTA
- "What's a problem you've encountered online that made you think 'someone should build this'?"
- "Have you been to a hackathon where the connections mattered more than the trophy?"
- "How do you verify information you see on social media?"

## Notes
- This is time-sensitive (just happened "this weekend") - should be written soon while fresh
- Great opportunity to show humility (didn't win) while demonstrating capability (built something impressive)
- Can position as validation of AI-assisted development approach
- Natural fit for both audiences: customers see practical AI application, founders see real hackathon experience
- Demo script is very polished - can reference or link to it
- Team members: Marto, Deqn, Nikolay, Erik (consider whether to tag them)

## Voice Considerations
- Keep it conversational and authentic
- Balance technical details with accessible storytelling
- Show enthusiasm without hype
- Be honest about not winning while reframing what success meant
- Avoid making it a product pitch - focus on the experience and learnings
