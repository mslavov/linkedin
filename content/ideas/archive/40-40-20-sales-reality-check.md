## Original Prompt
Monday and Tuesday I focused on selling. Recap of those two days: scraped 37 QA positions, of which 8 companies I think I can get a warm intro. Follow-ups with existing contacts. One official pilot kickoff (4-6 weeks, aiming for same bugs found, no increase in false positives). Great discovery call with a company I can help, as long as it becomes a priority for them. Tuesday I attended a local AI masterclass event - reconnected with familiar faces, met new people, got 2 leads. Sessions were tailored toward traditional businesses exploring AI, not dev shops.

## Core Idea
The reality of two days focused on selling - what the "40% Sell" part of the 40:40:20 rule actually looks like. Includes the AI Masterclass event experience and how interactions there shaped my view of what actual selling means.

## Key Points
- Scraped 37 QA positions â†’ 8 potential warm intro opportunities
- Mix of direct outreach and asking for connections
- First official Bugzy pilot kickoff (4-6 weeks, specific success metrics)
- Discovery call: great fit, but depends on their priorities
- AI Masterclass event: traditional businesses exploring AI (different audience than expected)
- Reconnected with familiar faces + met new people = 2 solid leads
- Realized through conversations: selling isn't just about the product, it's about understanding what audience actually needs

## Potential Hook
"I said I'd spend 40% of my time on sales. Here's what Monday and Tuesday actually looked like - from scraping job postings to an AI conference where I learned more by listening than pitching."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Direct follow-up to the 40:40:20 rule announcement
- Shows accountability and transparency
- Demonstrates the reality vs. theory of startup time management
- Sets up the pivot/rebuild story (sensing through conversations that different audiences need different solutions)

## Notes
- Two-day sales recap grounds the narrative in action, not theory
- AI Masterclass provides color and human interaction element
- Shows the unglamorous (scraping) and the glamorous (events) side of selling
- The pilot metrics are specific and impressive
- Traditional business audience observation foreshadows need for different product approach
- Vulnerability: depends on their priorities, learning through conversations
