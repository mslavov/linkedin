Three people reached out about Bugzy last week without me asking.

After posting about those 29 cold emails I couldn't send, this felt like validation. Like maybe the market is pulling instead of me having to push.

But here's what keeps me up: Is this real, or am I just seeing what I want to see?

Objectively, three is nothing. Could be timing, coincidence, LinkedIn's algorithm having a good week.

Subjectively? It feels huge. Especially when I've been avoiding the hard outbound work.

That's exactly what makes me nervous.

I just wrote about finding reasons not to send those emails. Now three people reach out, and part of me wants permission to stop pushing. "See? Inbound works."

That's the founder's cognitive trap.

When you're looking for validation, it's dangerously easy to over-interpret positive signals. To see three conversations as proof that cold outreach is unnecessary. To use lucky timing as an excuse.

So here's what I'm doing: treating this as encouragement, not permission.

I'm going to learn WHY these three people reached out. How they heard about Bugzy, what problem they're solving, whether they're actually ready to pilot.

And I'm still sending those damn cold emails. Three conversations doesn't erase 29 drafts sitting there.

The difference between an early signal and a feel-good illusion? An early signal leads to more work. An illusion becomes an excuse to avoid it.

I'm choosing signal. We'll see if I'm right.

How do you tell the difference between real market pull and confirmation bias?
