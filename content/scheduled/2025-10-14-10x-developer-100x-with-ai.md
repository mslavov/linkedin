I'll admit it sounds arrogant: I was 10x faster than some colleagues.

Not all of them. Just the ones who treated coding like a 9-to-5 checkbox. The ones who'd spend three days on a feature I'd ship in an afternoon.

Now with AI? I'm 100x-ing myself.

And I have proof.

Yesterday morning I started a conversation with Claude about designing a secure tunnel system. By afternoon, I had published an NPM package and Docker container for mcp-tunnel - a production-ready solution that lets AI agents communicate through firewalls.

Morning: architectural discussion
Midday: 1200-line design document
Afternoon: published package

This isn't about typing speed. The 10x developer debate was never about how fast you could write code. It was about judgment - knowing what to build, what to skip, and how systems fit together.

AI doesn't replace that judgment. It multiplies it.

The developers who were already exceptional? They're now operating at a completely different scale. We're not just shipping faster - we're solving entire categories of problems in the time it used to take to write a design doc.

But here's the uncomfortable truth: AI isn't leveling the playing field. It's amplifying the gap.

The difference between someone who understands systems and someone who just writes code? That gap is wider now, not smaller. Because AI will happily help you build the wrong thing perfectly.

You still need to know what "right" looks like. You still need to validate quality. You still need judgment about architecture, security, and when to ship.

The skill shift is real: we're moving from coding to system design and quality validation. From implementation to orchestration.

I'm not sure we're ready for what this means. 100x productivity gaps? That changes everything about how we build teams, price software, and think about engineering capacity.

How has AI changed your productivity? Are you seeing 2x, 10x, or something else entirely?
