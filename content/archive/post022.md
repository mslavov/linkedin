**Few minutes ago Anthropic announced that Claude Code is now part of their Pro subscription.  Not to be outdone, OpenAI followed up with an even bigger update.  Google, can you top that?**

In this short post I commented on the rapid pace of AI tool releases, jokingly challenging Google to respond.  I included a repost of Kevin Weil’s announcement from OpenAI.

Kevin shared a list of major updates rolling out to ChatGPT:

- **Deep Research** can now search across GitHub, Google Docs, Gmail, Calendar, Microsoft SharePoint, Outlook, OneDrive, HubSpot, Dropbox, Box and more.
- **Connectors** for linking any chat to Google Docs, SharePoint, Dropbox and Box.
- An initial version of **MCP support** (with HubSpot implemented via MCP).
- **Record mode** in ChatGPT to capture, transcribe and summarise meetings with structured output and full transcripts.
- **SSO for ChatGPT Team**.
- **Credit‑based pricing** for ChatGPT Enterprise and soon Team so that everyone can access advanced features.

Weil noted that the launches would roll out to B2B customers first and then to Pro and Plus users.
