I was supposed to write about Bugzy's delightful new Slack integration. Instead, I'm sitting here at 8 PM, 120 files deep into a refactoring I told myself would be "easy peasy lemon squeezy."

The plan was simple: stop copying instructions for each customer and generate them dynamically instead. Better scalability, easier to improve the agent globally. Two context windows with Claude Code, solid plan, confident execution.

Then I started reviewing the changes.

Leftovers. Technical debt from that "wasted work" I mentioned in previous posts. The kind of mess you see and think "well, if I'm already refactoring this..."

And that's when the digging started.

By afternoon, I was having the conversation every developer knows:

"Why did I start this? Was it that important?"
"This is how you move faster. This refactoring was needed at some point."
"But 120 files?"
"Just get through it. Test everything. Make sure nothing breaks."

Here's what's wild: this would've taken me at least two weeks solo. With Claude Code? Twelve hours. Still grinding through testing every piece of functionality, but the velocity is absurd.

The payoff (assuming I didn't break production):
• Ability to make global agent improvements
• Better context management - no unused MCPs, subagents, or slash commands
• A foundation that actually scales

The real question nobody talks about: when do you stop digging? How do you know if a refactoring is worth the disruption? I'm still not sure. Ask me again when I finish testing.

What's your rule of thumb for deciding if a refactoring is worth it? Or do you just dive in and rationalize later like I did?
