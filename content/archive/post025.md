I reshared an event announcement from **IncentivAI**, our sister company, promoting an evening of **DeFi insights and networking**.  The event was co‑hosted with **LAUNCHub Ventures** and **Daedalus Angels** and carried the tongue‑in‑cheek title *“DeFi isn’t dead, your DD just sucks.”*  My repost helped spread the word to friends interested in decentralised finance.
