## Original Prompt
Monday morning weekly planning: what should I focus on:
1. Sales - I have 3 pilots, 3 qualified leads, 6 interested companies to learn more 30+ cold leads. Do I need more?
2. Improve the product - overall I think I've reached the working MVP stage, but there are many many things that can be improved or bugs to be fixed (yeah, I know about the lists on the homepage :D)
3. Improve the agent - Let's the agent is still needs fine tunning, as some of the steps it does should not be done, or it skips steps, etc.

Here is my plan, not sure I will follow the 40:40:20 this week, as I think the top priority is getting the agent amazing at doing its job as Senior QA engineer. I will still keep nurturing the contacts I've made and continue with those 12 companies. I will fix the product itself if I have to.

## Core Idea
The reality of startup prioritization when theory meets practice. The 40:40:20 rule (40% build, 40% sell, 20% AI ops) is a great framework, but real Monday mornings force tough choices. This week: betting on agent quality over everything else.

## Key Points
- **The Framework vs. Reality**: Have a framework (40:40:20) but be willing to break it when priorities shift
- **Current State**: 3 pilots + 3 qualified leads + 6 interested + 30+ cold = solid pipeline, not desperate for more leads
- **The Bet**: Agent quality is the bottleneck - if the agent doesn't deliver as a "Senior QA Engineer," nothing else matters
- **The Discipline**: Still nurturing the 12 active companies, fixing product bugs only "if I have to"
- **Self-Aware Humor**: Acknowledging the homepage bugs with a :D - transparency about imperfection

## Potential Hook
"Monday morning. Three pilots running. Six qualified leads. Thirty cold leads in the pipeline.

And I'm ignoring my 40:40:20 rule this week."

OR

"Every Monday I plan to split my time: 40% build, 40% sell, 20% AI ops.

This Monday? 80% on making the agent not suck."

## Connection to Previous Content
- References the 40:40:20 framework from earlier posts
- Continues the Bugzy journey narrative
- Shows the evolution from "building an MVP" to "making it actually work well"
- Authentic founder journey: not just wins, but real decision-making struggles

## Notes
- This is a great "building in public" moment - showing the messy reality of prioritization
- Opportunity to discuss when to break your own rules
- Could resonate with fellow founders struggling with similar choices
- Shows confidence in the pipeline (not desperate for more leads) which is actually a good signal
- The humor about homepage bugs shows self-awareness and transparency
- Timing: Monday morning posts about planning could become a recurring theme

## Possible Angles
1. **The Prioritization Dilemma**: When do you break your own framework?
2. **Quality vs. Quantity**: Why perfecting the agent beats adding features
3. **Pipeline Confidence**: How to know when you have "enough" leads
4. **Solo Founder Reality**: The constant juggling act of build/sell/improve
5. **Betting on Foundations**: Why core quality matters more than polish at this stage
