Well, here's something they don't tell you about AI conferences.

Picture this: AI Engineer Paris, Station F. Hundreds of developers gathered to push the boundaries of AI. Everyone's laptops open, Claude Code running, building demos for the hallway track.

Then boom - API overload errors. Everywhere.

Turns out when you concentrate this many AI engineers in one building, all hitting the same regional Claude endpoints simultaneously, something's gotta give. The infrastructure equivalent of everyone flushing at halftime.

Meanwhile, back home in Bulgaria, the APIs work perfectly fine. Different region, zero congestion.

The options became clear:
1. Bring your own GPUs to conferences (portable H100 anyone?)
2. VPN back to a less saturated region
3. Accept that the best place to use AI during an AI conference is... not at the conference

We spent the day discussing context windows, agent architectures, and production deployments - while unable to actually test any of it. The ultimate live demo failure, except it happened to everyone.

This isn't just a funny story. It's a real infrastructure challenge as AI adoption accelerates. Conference organizers might need to start coordinating with API providers. "Expected attendance: 2000 developers, all running continuous integration tests."

Maybe Bulgaria's lower AI usage isn't a disadvantage after all. Or maybe we're secretly training our own models here and just not telling anyone. ðŸš€

Next conference, I'm bringing a GPU cluster in my backpack. Just in case.

What's the most ironic technical failure you've experienced? When has being in the "wrong" place turned out to be exactly right?
