“It’s always weird when you see your face on the Internet 😂” – that’s how I introduced a repost from **Telerik Academy**.  I expressed my gratitude for the opportunity to work with Telerik Academy and meet so many great people.  At TOKI we believe that strong fundamentals lead to generational change, and investing in junior talent is part of our mission.
