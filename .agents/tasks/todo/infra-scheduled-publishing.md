# Implement Scheduled Publishing System

## Context
- PRD: [Initial PRD](../../../docs/product/initial-prd.md)
- Architecture: [LinkedIn Automation Architecture](../../../scratch/linkedin-automation-architecture.md)
- Related Tasks: Automated daily posting to LinkedIn

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create GitHub Action for scheduled publishing
- [ ] Implement optimal posting time configuration
- [ ] Add daily post limit enforcement (1-2 posts)
- [ ] Create pre-publishing validation checks
- [ ] Implement queue selection logic
- [ ] Add publishing execution with error handling
- [ ] Set up success/failure notifications
- [ ] Create publishing logs and analytics
- [ ] Add manual override capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Posts are published automatically at scheduled times
- [ ] Daily limits are enforced (max 2 posts)
- [ ] Next post is selected intelligently from queue
- [ ] Publishing failures are notified immediately
- [ ] Manual override allows immediate publishing
- [ ] All publishes are logged with metrics
- [ ] System respects LinkedIn rate limits
- [ ] Scheduling is configurable and timezone-aware

## Technical Notes
- Use cron for scheduling with timezone support
- Implement circuit breaker for repeated failures
- Consider LinkedIn's optimal posting times
- Add jitter to avoid exact-time posting
- Implement health checks before publishing
- Use GitHub Action artifacts for logs
- Consider webhook notifications for status

## Testing Requirements
- Test scheduling accuracy
- Verify daily limit enforcement
- Test queue selection logic
- Test failure handling and notifications
- Verify timezone handling
- Test manual override functionality
- Ensure idempotent publishing
