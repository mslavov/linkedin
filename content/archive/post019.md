I was excited to be a guest on the latest episode of the **ICTalks** podcast 🎙️.  We talked about how technology can help optimise electricity expenses and how our platform **TOKI** uses IoT integration to provide real‑time monitoring and energy efficiency for businesses and households.  It’s always great to share our vision for a smarter energy future.
