Tuesday afternoon. I'm sitting there looking at Bugzy, which now has decent observability and a solid Slack UX.

And I realize: this thing handles customer code. Customer data. Test results. Logs.

I should probably make it GDPR compliant.

In the old world, this is where you'd:
- Hire a compliance consultant
- Schedule meetings with lawyers
- Spend weeks implementing data handling policies
- Pay someone to audit your implementation
- Maybe get it right in a month or two

I did what every AI-addicted engineer does instead.

Opened Claude Desktop: "What do I need to make a QA automation agent GDPR compliant?"

Got a comprehensive breakdown. Data processing agreements. Right to erasure. Data retention policies. Consent mechanisms. Security requirements.

Then opened Claude Code: "Implement these GDPR requirements."

Data retention policies? Implemented.
User data deletion endpoints? Added.
Audit logging? Built in.
Privacy controls? Done.

Four hours. From "I should probably handle this" to "legally compliant product."

The meta levels here are absurd. Using AI to research compliance requirements for AI products. Using AI to implement the code that makes AI products compliant with AI-era regulations.

We're eating our own dog food while building the kitchen.

Now, I'm not saying this replaces proper legal review. When Bugzy grows, I'll get actual lawyers to check this. But for a bootstrapped product in private beta? Being able to ship compliant-by-default instead of compliant-eventually changes everything.

The barrier between "I should do this" and "I did this" has collapsed.

What compliance or legal work have you been putting off because it seemed too complex? Might be easier than you think now.
