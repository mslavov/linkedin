Three days with my family. Should be easy, right?

Of course I should go. Family time you can't make up later. No question about it.

Then I looked at my calendar. Calls scheduled. Plans made. Three pilots running. Leads in the pipeline.

The question hit me: What do I actually do here?

Option A: "Sorry, I'm on vacation" + out-of-office auto-reply. Be unavailable. Trust everything holds.

Option B: Be there for support. Do some work here and there. Stay responsive.

I chose Option B.

Monday: Most calls of the week. Spent the whole day prepping and executing. Vacation day one, working full-time.

Tuesday morning: 5 AM in the hotel lobby, laptop open, welcoming the hotel staff as they started their shifts. Worked until breakfast. Afternoon with family.

Wednesday: Same thing. Morning work session. Afternoon disconnect.

Here's what nobody tells you about solo founding: the "should I go on vacation" question has a clear answer. The "how do I actually take vacation" question doesn't.

Because when you're the only one, customers don't pause. The product doesn't go on auto-pilot. And "I'll deal with it when I'm back" isn't an option when you're building trust with early pilots.

So you end up in hotel lobbies at 5 AM, trying to split the difference between being present for family and being available for customers who are trusting you with their QA process.

The irony isn't lost on me: I'm building Bugzy to give QA teams their time back. Meanwhile, I'm working from a hotel lobby because I can't figure out how to give myself three days off.

How do you handle this as a solo founder? Have you found the answer? Or are you also greeting hotel staff at 5 AM while your family sleeps?
