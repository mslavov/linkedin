Two weeks ago I automated my LinkedIn posting. Today I'm wondering: can I run my entire business the same way?

Picture this: your business operations as a GitHub repository. Product roadmaps in markdown. Customer feedback as issues. Financial reports generated from data files. Claude Code handling everything from sprint planning to sales outreach.

Here's what "Business as Code" could look like:

**Product Development**
• Feature requests → GitHub issues
• Sprint planning → Automated project boards
• User research → AI analyzing issue patterns

**Marketing & Sales**
• Content strategy → Scheduled workflows
• Lead outreach → Personalized templates + automation
• Analytics → Generated dashboards from raw data

**Operations**
• Financial tracking → Structured data + AI reports
• Legal docs → Version-controlled templates
• Customer support → AI-first, human-reviewed

The tricky part? Unlike code, businesses deal with sensitive data. Customer info, financials, contracts - things you can't just push to a public repo.

Private repos solve the technical problem. But the philosophical question remains: how much of running a business is actually automatable pattern matching vs genuine human judgment?

After 20+ years building systems, I've learned that the best automation amplifies human decisions rather than replacing them. Just like my LinkedIn automation doesn't write posts from scratch - it helps me maintain my voice at scale.

Maybe "Business as Code" isn't about full automation. It's about creating reproducible systems, tracking decisions like commits, and using AI to handle the repetitive while humans focus on the creative.

Has anyone else experimented with treating business operations like code? What worked? What spectacularly failed?
