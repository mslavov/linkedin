I reshared a post from **TOKI** about our visit to the **E‑world energy & water 2023** trade fair in Essen, Germany.  The event brought together experts from 27 countries to discuss energy supply, smart grids, diversification of production and storage, electromobility, hydrogen and heat transition.  Our team exchanged ideas with partners and looked for innovative solutions for the Bulgarian and regional markets.
