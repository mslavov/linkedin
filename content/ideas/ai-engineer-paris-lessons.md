## Core Idea
Share the most impactful lessons and insights from AI Engineer Paris conference - focusing on unexpected discoveries, emerging trends, and practical takeaways that attendees can apply immediately. Move beyond the obvious keynote highlights to share the corridor conversations and workshop revelations that truly shaped perspectives.

## Key Points
- The gap between AI hype and practical implementation reality
- Emerging patterns in successful AI engineering teams and workflows
- Tools and frameworks gaining real traction vs. those losing momentum
- Network effects: The most valuable connections weren't always the speakers
- Unexpected technical insights from workshop sessions
- European vs. US approaches to AI development and regulation

## Potential Hook
"The best insights at AI Engineer Paris didn't come from the main stage - they came from the debugging session at 2 AM when three engineers figured out why their RAG pipeline kept hallucinating French poetry."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Connects to the published post about attending AI Engineer Paris (2025-09-09)
- Builds on themes of practical AI implementation and real-world engineering challenges
- Can reference the Bugzy announcement if it was made at the conference
- Ties into ongoing narrative about building AI tools and automation

## Notes
- Time-sensitive: Should be published soon after the conference while insights are fresh
- Could include specific tools or techniques discovered at the conference
- Opportunity to highlight connections made and potential collaborations
- Can contrast expectations vs. reality of the conference
- Include actionable takeaways for those who couldn't attend
- Consider mentioning standout presentations or demos that challenged assumptions
