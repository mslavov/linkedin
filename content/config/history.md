### October 10, 2025 - Warp Terminal: The AI Feature I Completely Missed
**Summary**: Humorous discovery that Warp Terminal had AI features all along - switched from iTerm2 for pretty UI, completely missed the actual innovation. Self-deprecating story about being so focused on building AI tools that missed using AI in everyday workflow.
**Key Theme**: Developer tool discovery, missing obvious features, workflow optimization, humorous self-deprecation
**Style**: Light, funny, self-aware about tunnel vision
**Narrative**: Provides variety after sales/ethics posts, returns to technical tooling but with humor
**Engagement Hook**: Discovery of AI feature already in daily-used tool
**Technical Focus**: Warp Terminal AI features, terminal productivity

### October 14, 2025 - The 10x Developer Was Real. Now AI Makes It 100x
**Summary**: Bold claim backed by concrete example: built mcp-tunnel from architectural discussion to published NPM package in one day. Argues that AI amplifies the judgment gap between exceptional developers and code writers - the 10x debate was always about system understanding, not typing speed. AI multiplies existing judgment rather than replacing it, widening the productivity gap instead of leveling the playing field.
**Key Theme**: AI productivity amplification, 10x developer debate validation, skill shift to system design and quality validation
**Style**: Provocative opening ("sounds arrogant"), proof-driven with concrete metrics, uncomfortable truth-telling about widening gaps
**Narrative**: Technical achievement story (mcp-tunnel) used to explore broader implications of AI on developer productivity and team dynamics
**Engagement Hook**: "How has AI changed your productivity? Are you seeing 2x, 10x, or something else entirely?"
**Technical Focus**: mcp-tunnel package (secure tunnel for AI agents through firewalls), 1200-line design doc to production in hours
**Key Insight**: Moving from coding to system design/quality validation, from implementation to orchestration - AI doesn't level the playing field, it amplifies judgment gaps
