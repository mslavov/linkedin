Three weeks ago I automated my LinkedIn posts with GitHub Actions and Claude Code. Last week I spent 3 days extracting something unexpected from Bugzy's architecture.

Here's the progression that led me down this rabbit hole:

Started simple: GitHub issue → Claude generates post → PR for review → scheduled publishing. It worked beautifully. Cut my content creation time by 90%.

Then the dangerous thought: "If I can automate content, why not everything else?"

First attempt: Business-as-code. Everything in GitHub - customer feedback, product roadmap, support tickets. Write Markdown, push commits, watch workflows run. Felt clever for about 12 hours.

Then it hit me: I'm already building Bugzy - an autonomous QA agent with all the orchestration capabilities I need. The core components I built for QA testing aren't actually QA-specific. They're generic agent orchestration building blocks.

So I spent 3 days extracting and generalizing Bugzy's architecture. The agent runner container I built? Works for any task, not just QA. The secret management system? Handles credentials for any integration. The MCP config management for tool orchestration? Perfect for any agent workflow. And Git as the storage layer? Turns out version-controlled memory works for business operations too.

Now I'm building a generic orchestration platform with these exact components. Customer email comes in? Agent reads it, stores context in Git, drafts response. Need market research? Agent searches, commits findings, creates tracked action items. Invoice processing? Agent extracts data, updates records with full audit trail, schedules payments.

The beautiful part? By reusing and improving these components, I'm actually working on Bugzy itself. Not starting yet another side project. Every enhancement to my business automation directly improves my product. Every bug I fix in my internal tools makes Bugzy better. I'm literally dogfooding my way to product-market fit.

I'm essentially turning my specialized QA agent into the foundation for any business agent. It's like discovering your racing engine can power any vehicle, not just race cars.

The 3-day deep dive taught me something crucial: specialized AI agents often contain generic solutions. Bugzy isn't just a QA tool - it's an agent orchestration platform that happens to be really good at QA.

After years of building automation tools at VMware, then watching everyone struggle with them, I finally get it. The future isn't visual workflows or specialized agents. It's composable agent platforms where the same core can power QA, sales, support, or any business process.

Is it perfect? No. Do agents sometimes do weird things? Absolutely. But unlike traditional automation, when something breaks, I can literally tell it to fix itself.

What started as a QA agent is becoming the operating system for my company. And honestly? The best products often emerge from solving your own specific problem first.

What specialized tool have you built that turned out to be more universal than you expected?
