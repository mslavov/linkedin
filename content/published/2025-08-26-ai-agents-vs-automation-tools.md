What if I told you that your carefully crafted automation workflows are about to become as obsolete as writing assembly code? Well, not quite - but hear me out.

Back in my VMware vRO days, we understood workflows deeply - how they executed, how state machines worked, the whole orchestration engine. But we hated building them. Despised it so much that we spent months creating a TypeScript transpiler just to avoid dragging boxes around and connecting arrows. We wanted to write code, not play with visual Legos.

That transpiler was our collective escape attempt from workflow hell. Our team's rebellion against "if-then-else" diamonds and decision nodes. When I got n8n free from Lenny's Newsletter Product Pass, I thought maybe modern tools would be different. Used it once. The boxes were prettier, but it was still boxes.

Then Claude Code and MCP happened. And suddenly I could just... describe what I wanted? "When I get an email about a deployment, summarize it and notify the team." No flowcharts. No transpiling. No debugging webhook payloads at 11 PM.

It felt like vindication. This conversational approach - this was what we'd been trying to achieve with that TypeScript transpiler years ago. Skip the visual abstraction layer. Just say what you want done.

After months of working with both approaches, here's the nuanced reality:

Traditional tools still win when:
â€¢ You need 100% predictable execution
â€¢ The workflow rarely changes
â€¢ You're dealing with sensitive data
â€¢ Cost per execution matters

AI agents shine when:
â€¢ Requirements keep evolving
â€¢ You need intelligent decision-making
â€¢ The workflow has many edge cases
â€¢ You value development speed over runtime cost

The plot twist? People are using n8n to build AI agents. Connecting boxes to call OpenAI APIs, chaining prompts through workflows. What they probably don't realize is they already have a platform for building super powerful agents: Claude Code with MCP. No boxes needed.

And yes, I'm basically getting enterprise-grade automation for "free" with my Claude subscription. Until they change the pricing. Which they will. Because they always do. ðŸ˜…

What's your automation story? Are you still using traditional workflow builders, or have you made the jump to AI agents too?
