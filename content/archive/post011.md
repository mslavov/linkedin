It bothers me when people dismiss science.  In this post I wrote about how **climate change** is a reality and how important it is to trust **science** and experts.  I drew a parallel with the pandemic: when the next crisis comes we will need vaccines and data‑driven solutions, so we must work on persuading people to believe in evidence.  The post included a link to a video explaining climate change.
