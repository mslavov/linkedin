Three weeks ago I automated my LinkedIn posts with GitHub Actions and Claude Code. Last week I spent 3 days rebuilding how I run my entire company.

Here's the progression that led me down this rabbit hole:

Started simple: GitHub issue → Claude generates post → PR for review → scheduled publishing. It worked beautifully. Cut my content creation time by 90%.

Then the dangerous thought: "If I can automate content, why not everything else?"

First attempt: Business-as-code. Everything in GitHub - customer feedback, product roadmap, support tickets. Write YAML, push commits, watch workflows run. Felt clever for about 12 hours.

Then reality hit. I was building the exact workflow orchestration nightmare I escaped at VMware. Visual builders, YAML configs, rigid pipelines. The tools I swore I'd never touch again.

Plot twist: I'm literally building Bugzy - an AI agent platform. Why was I using GitHub Actions when I could use... my own product?

So I spent 3 days moving everything to Bugzy's agent orchestration. Customer email comes in? Agent reads it, updates context, drafts response. Need market research? Agent searches, summarizes, creates action items. Invoice processing? Agent extracts data, updates accounting, schedules payments.

The beautiful part? Every internal tool I build becomes a Bugzy feature. Every workflow I create validates the platform. Every bug I hit gets fixed for customers too.

I'm essentially using my startup to build my startup. It's either genius or insane - probably both.

The 3-day deep dive taught me something crucial: we don't need more workflow builders. We need agents that understand context and intent. Not "if this then that" but "here's what needs doing, figure it out."

After years of building automation tools at VMware, then watching everyone struggle with them, I finally get it. The future isn't visual workflows or YAML configs. It's conversational orchestration. Tell the agent what you want. Let it handle the how.

Is it perfect? No. Do agents sometimes do weird things? Absolutely. But unlike traditional automation, when something breaks, I can literally tell it to fix itself.

What started as LinkedIn automation has become the operating system for my company. And honestly? I can't imagine going back to the old way.

What's one business process you'd love to hand off to an AI agent today?
