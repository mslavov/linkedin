Last weekend, I tried using a personal finance SaaS I built 6 years ago. It still worked, but something felt... antiquated. Not the tech stack – the entire approach.

That's when it clicked: why am I clicking through dashboards when I could just ask questions?

So I did what any engineer does with a free weekend – I built a quick fix for my own problem. In just a couple of hours, I threw together an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects Claude Code directly to bank accounts through Open Banking. Now I can ask: "What did I spend on coffee last month?" or "Can I afford that new server cluster?" and get instant answers.

The technical part? Surprisingly straightforward. Open Banking has matured significantly since my last look 6 years ago. What used to take weeks now takes a couple of hours on a weekend.

This wasn't supposed to be a product – just a personal tool to scratch my own itch. But now I'm curious: Would others find value in AI-first personal finance insights?

The builder in me thinks maybe – we're replacing static dashboards with dynamic conversations. The skeptic (who's seen plenty of hype cycles) wonders if people actually want their AI reading bank statements.

What's your take? Would you trust an AI with read-only access to your financial data if it meant getting instant, personalized insights? 

P.S. The funny thing? People who know me are probably thinking "Wait, weren't you working on something else?" Yep, still am! This was just an unexpected weekend detour to solve a personal annoyance. Sometimes the best hacks are the ones you build for yourself.
