## Original Prompt
I haven't worked on the product for a week. Since last Thursday, I focused on defining my ICP, reaching out to people, having conversations. And I even refined the ICP in the process. Now Bugzy is about helping teams close the gap in their testing. Also another thing I realized is I want to pivot from Manual QA to Automation QA. So, Bugzy will no longer "manually" go through the steps in each test case, but will also create the automation.

## Core Idea
A transparent story about what happens when you stop building and start talking to customers. A week of customer development led to two major insights: a clearer ICP (teams struggling with testing gaps) and a significant product pivot (from manual QA execution to automation creation). This is the 40:40:20 rule in action - spending 40% on Sell taught you what you needed to change in the 40% Build time.

## Key Points
- The decision to pause product work for a full week of customer conversations
- What "closing the gap in testing" actually means (from customer pain points)
- The pivot realization: teams don't need another tool to run manual tests, they need automation they don't have time to write
- Why automation QA is the real leverage point vs. manual test execution
- The validation process: how conversations with real teams shaped this direction
- The irony: building an AI agent that doesn't just test, but creates the testing infrastructure
- Practical next steps: how this changes Bugzy's roadmap

## Potential Hook
"I didn't touch my product for a week. Best decision I've made this year."

or

"A week of customer calls taught me more than a month of coding. Bugzy is pivoting, and here's why..."

or

"Turns out nobody wants an AI to manually run their test cases. They want an AI to write the automation they never had time to create."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Direct application of the 40:40:20 rule (40% Sell led to insights for 40% Build)
- Shows the customer development process in action, not just theory
- Demonstrates the "listening to feedback" approach mentioned in best practices
- Builds on the Bugzy narrative from previous posts but shows evolution
- Validates the hypothesis that talking to customers > building in isolation

## Notes
- This is a HIGH priority - fresh insight, clear pivot story, demonstrates founder learning
- Dual audience appeal: founders learn about customer development importance, potential customers see you're responsive to real needs
- Consider sharing specific pain points you heard in conversations
- The "automation gap" is a concrete problem teams face - closing it is valuable
- Could mention specific ICP criteria you landed on (without being too salesy)
- Perfect example of building in public - sharing the pivot decision and reasoning
- Shows vulnerability (admitting initial direction needed adjustment) and strength (decisive pivot based on data)
- Ties into AI practicality theme from your voice: AI should create leverage (automation) not just mimic manual work
- Could reference the TOKI experience (100% automation) as proof you understand automation value
