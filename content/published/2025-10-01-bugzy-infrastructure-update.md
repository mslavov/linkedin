I haven't touched Bugzy's QA agent in two weeks.

Instead, I've been building the infrastructure that'll actually support it—an agent orchestration platform I'm now calling AgentForge (more on that tomorrow, maybe).

Here's what "not touching the agent" actually looked like:

The Agent Runner:
Completely rebuilt. Now stateless with single concurrent connections. No shared state, no race conditions, no "but it worked on my machine" surprises. It's a hermetically sealed execution environment where your agent runs safely, does its thing, and leaves no trace.

Integration Layer:
Created https://www.npmjs.com/package/nextjs-nango-plugin - makes plugging 500+ integrations into a Next.js app almost trivially easy. GitHub, Linear, Slack, you name it.

The Reusable Parts:
Here's where it got interesting. Built all this for AgentForge, then realized Bugzy can use:
• Team and project management (multi-tenant from day one)
• Plans + usage-based billing (because AI agent pricing is... fun)
• VFS backed by Git (version control for everything)
• Execution logs with real-time streaming (watch your agents work)

The Plan:
While I'm delivering Bugzy manually (yes, I'm the QA agent right now), I'm rebuilding bugzy.ai to integrate all these components into a self-serve product.

Why manually first? Because the best way to understand what the automation needs to do is to do it yourself. Every repetitive task I curse at becomes a feature requirement.

Sometimes the most important product work happens when you're NOT working on the product itself.

We'll see how this goes in the next few weeks.

What's the longest you've spent building infrastructure before shipping the actual feature?
