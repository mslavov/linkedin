## Recently Published Posts

### August 14, 2025 - Building a Baby Monitor for Claude Code
**Summary**: Created iOS notifications for Claude Code prompts after finding it waiting patiently for hours multiple times. Simple hook â†’ bash â†’ Pushcut setup reduced response time from 2.5 hours to 3 minutes.
**Key Theme**: Practical AI tooling, solving real workflow problems
**Style**: Humorous (baby/toddler metaphor), concrete metrics, open source sharing
**Narrative**: AI assistants as productive but needy tools requiring human oversight
**Hashtags**: #AI #ClaudeCode #DeveloperTools #Automation #BuildingInPublic #Productivity

### August 19, 2025 - From Constant Disappointment to Workflow Discovery
**Summary**: Discovered through Claude Code analyzing its own chat history that successful projects start small, not with comprehensive planning. Realized overplanning with powerful AI was counterproductive - same principles that make code maintainable apply to AI workflows.
**Key Theme**: AI workflow optimization, meta-learning from tool usage patterns
**Style**: Vulnerable admission of failures, practical insights, self-reflective
**Narrative**: Learning to work WITH AI tools rather than forcing old patterns
**Hashtags**: #AIAssistedDevelopment #ClaudeCode #DeveloperProductivity #CodingWorkflow #BuildingWithAI

### August 20, 2025 - When 'Hey Siri, Turn On The Lights' Just Isn't Nerdy Enough
**Summary**: Built Shelly MCP to control smart home devices through Claude instead of Siri, because typing commands to an AI during 5 AM coding sessions seemed more efficient than voice commands. Open-sourced the over-engineered solution that bridges MCP protocol with Shelly Cloud API.
**Key Theme**: Developer humor, practical over-engineering, smart home automation
**Style**: Self-deprecating humor ("normal people don't code at 5 AM"), playful about complexity
**Narrative**: Natural progression from Claude Code tools to expanding AI's reach into physical environment
**Engagement Hook**: "What's the most unnecessarily complex solution you've built for a simple problem?"
**Hashtags**: #AI #SmartHome #OpenSource #DeveloperTools #BuildingInPublic #HomeAutomation #MCP
