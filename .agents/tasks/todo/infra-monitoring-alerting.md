# Implement Monitoring and Alerting System

## Context
- PRD: [Initial PRD](../../../docs/product/initial-prd.md)
- Architecture: [LinkedIn Automation Architecture](../../../scratch/linkedin-automation-architecture.md)
- Related Tasks: Operational monitoring for reliability

## Subtasks
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions status monitoring
- [ ] Implement sync failure detection and alerts
- [ ] Add content generation failure monitoring
- [ ] Monitor LinkedIn API health and quotas
- [ ] Create publishing failure alerts
- [ ] Set up queue health monitoring
- [ ] Implement notification channels (email, Slack)
- [ ] Create operational dashboard
- [ ] Add automatic recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Document runbooks for common issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All critical failures trigger alerts
- [ ] Alerts include actionable information
- [ ] False positives are minimized
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms work automatically
- [ ] Dashboard shows system health at a glance
- [ ] Runbooks cover common scenarios
- [ ] Alert fatigue is avoided
- [ ] Historical metrics are retained

## Technical Notes
- Use GitHub Actions built-in monitoring
- Consider external monitoring service
- Implement smart alert grouping
- Add alert severity levels
- Include self-healing capabilities
- Use structured logging
- Consider SLO/SLA tracking

## Testing Requirements
- Test alert triggering for all scenarios
- Verify notification delivery
- Test automatic recovery mechanisms
- Ensure dashboard accuracy
- Test under various failure modes
- Verify runbook procedures
- Test alert suppression logic
