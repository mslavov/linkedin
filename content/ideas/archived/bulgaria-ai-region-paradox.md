## Original Prompt
Sunday fun post: I wonder should I have brought with me GPUs to be able to work at AI Engineer Paris, or actually I'm happy I live in Bulgaria, as it seems here we use a different region, but it is sad at the same time as it means in Bulgaria we are not using AI a lot to overload Anthropic's APIs, or we are cooking our own models here :D Who knows [Image #1]

## Core Idea
A humorous yet frustrating observation about experiencing API overload errors while physically at AI Engineer Paris conference - ironically, the concentration of AI engineers at the conference seems to be overloading the local region's API capacity, while back home in Bulgaria the APIs work fine due to lower usage. This raises interesting questions about regional infrastructure and the unintended consequences of tech conferences.

## Key Points
- The irony of not being able to use AI APIs at an AI conference due to overload
- Everyone at the conference hitting the same regional endpoints simultaneously
- Bulgaria having better availability simply due to lower concurrent usage
- The question of whether to bring your own GPUs to conferences as backup
- The unexpected advantage of working from "less popular" AI regions
- The possibility that Bulgaria might be quietly developing its own AI infrastructure

## Potential Hook
"Imagine going to an AI conference and not being able to use AI because everyone else at the conference is using it too."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Relates to AI Engineer Paris conference insights shared earlier
- Continues the narrative about practical AI engineering experiences
- Adds to the ongoing discussion about regional differences in tech adoption
- Connects to themes about working remotely vs. in-person at tech events

## Notes
- Include the screenshot showing the error message from the Paris conference
- Keep the tone light and humorous while sharing a genuine frustration
- This is a real infrastructure problem that affects conference productivity
- Could explore the "tragedy of the commons" aspect of AI API usage at conferences
- Highlight the practical challenges of working with cloud AI services at scale
- Consider mentioning how conference organizers might need to plan for this in the future
- The irony that physical presence at an AI conference can be a disadvantage for actually using AI
