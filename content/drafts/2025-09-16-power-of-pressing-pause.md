After 20+ years of back-to-back sprints, I'm doing something radical: absolutely nothing for a week.

Tomorrow marks my first day as a full-time founder. But instead of diving straight into 14-hour days of building (tempting as that is), I'm taking a full week to recharge.

**The logic is simple:**
â€¢ You can't pour from an empty cup
â€¢ Starting exhausted guarantees burnout by month 3
â€¢ Clear thinking requires a clear mind
â€¢ This might be my last chance for a break in years

I've already disabled Slack, hidden my IDE, and told Claude Code we're on a break (it took it surprisingly well).

The plan? Reading fiction. Long walks. Actual sleep. Maybe remembering what food tastes like when you're not eating at your desk. Revolutionary stuff.

The builder in me is screaming "you're wasting precious time!" But the experienced leader knows better. The best decisions, the most creative solutions, the breakthrough moments â€“ they come from a rested mind.

So here's to strategic laziness. To intentional pause. To investing in the long game.

Fellow founders: When did you last take a real break? Not a weekend where you "just checked email quickly" â€“ but an actual, disconnected, do-nothing break?

See you on the other side, recharged and ready to build. ðŸ”‹
