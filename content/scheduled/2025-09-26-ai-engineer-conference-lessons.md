Sometimes the best conference validation comes from the most unexpected places.

At AI Engineer Paris this week, I wasn't expecting swyx to validate my Bugzy approach during a casual expo chat. Or to discover that Pierre Burgy's "Vibes > Benchmarks" talk would perfectly justify my decision to postpone comprehensive evals and just ship.

But that's exactly what happened.

The Bugzy journey has been full of second-guessing. Am I crazy for building a QA layer on top of existing AI coding agents? Should I really be trusting vibes over building an eval suite first? The imposter syndrome was real.

Then swyx mentioned how Zed's A2C enables swapping of agents - essentially validating the exact architecture I'd been building. Not a crazy idea after all.

Pierre's talk hit even harder. While everyone's obsessing over benchmarks and eval scores, he argued for trusting product intuition first. Ship it, see if it works, THEN build the measurement infrastructure. Exactly the decision I'd made last week but was doubting.

The reality checks were equally valuable. Graphite's "revolutionary" chat feature? It's basically Claude Code plus GitHub Actions. Good execution, sure, but a reminder that sometimes innovation is just combining existing tools well. Makes me think harder about Bugzy's true differentiation.

Then there were the human moments. Hearing Bulgarian across the expo floor and meeting Anton and Stanislav from Cast AI - a reminder that our tech world is smaller than we think. Or the 2 AM debugging session where three of us figured out why a RAG pipeline kept hallucinating (spoiler: embeddings in the wrong language).

The tools that caught my eye weren't the flashy AI frameworks. It was Alpic's MCP deployment with built-in analytics - the boring infrastructure that actually makes AI agents production-ready. That's what we really need.

Three days in Paris confirmed what months of building taught me: The gap between AI hype and implementation reality is where the real work happens. Everyone's struggling with the same problems - evals, production deployment, context management. The winners aren't the ones with perfect solutions; they're the ones who ship despite the imperfections.

Back to building. This time with less doubt and more conviction.

What's the one piece of external validation that changed your product trajectory?
