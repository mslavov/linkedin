## Original Prompt
Follow-up to previous posts about building an agent orchestration platform I planned to use for rebuilding Bugzy. Monday's success with selling created pressure to deliver - I'm promising the agent will be connected to different systems, so I must deliver on that promise. Started by creating a 1,600-line plan to port all features and functionalities I wanted to reuse from the agent orchestration platform to Bugzy. During the Tuesday conference (AI Masterclass), I reviewed what it did, suggested changes, and updated it. Today (Wednesday) I have it working, but I'm adjusting it so it makes sense for the QA agent itself. May wait to generate the post until I see what happens today and can provide additional details.

## Core Idea
The pressure of successful selling forcing you to deliver on promises - and how a 1,600-line AI-generated plan helped rebuild Bugzy to connect to different systems. Not about the event itself, but about the technical execution driven by customer pressure.

## Key Points
- Follow-up to agent orchestration platform posts
- Monday's sales success created delivery pressure
- Promised the agent would connect to different systems - must deliver
- Created 1,600-line plan to port features from orchestration platform to Bugzy
- Tuesday during conference: reviewed, suggested changes, iterated
- Wednesday: it's working, but adjusting to make sense for QA agent specifically
- Shows the cycle: sell → pressure to deliver → rapid technical execution
- Story still developing - may wait for more details from Wednesday's work

## Potential Hook
"Monday I sold successfully. Tuesday I panicked. Wednesday I'm rebuilding Bugzy with a 1,600-line plan because I promised customers something I haven't built yet."

OR

"Success in sales is great until you realize you promised to connect your agent to systems that don't exist yet. Here's how I'm fixing that."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Direct follow-up to agent orchestration platform posts
- Demonstrates the 40:40:20 rule reality: selling creates pressure to build
- Shows the technical side of promises made during sales conversations
- Connects Monday sales pressure to immediate technical action
- The cycle of startup reality: promise → deliver → adjust

## Notes
- Not centered on the AI Masterclass event - that's in the sales post
- Focuses on technical execution and delivery pressure
- The 1,600-line plan is a compelling, specific detail
- Conference becomes background context (working on plan during sessions)
- Shows iteration: plan → review → working → adjusting
- Story still unfolding - authentic to wait for Wednesday's outcome
- Demonstrates the pressure successful selling creates
- Could include specifics about what "connecting to different systems" means for the QA agent
