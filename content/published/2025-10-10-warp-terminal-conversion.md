I've been using Warp for weeks. Like a regular terminal. You know, terminal things.

It came free with my product pass, so I installed it. Typed commands. Got output. That's it.

Here's the embarrassing part: I'm the guy who evangelizes AI features in dev tools. I build AI agents. I automate everything with Claude. I literally can't shut up about AI making developers more productive.

And I completely ignored the AI features in my own terminal.

Then last Sunday afternoon, my Raspberry Pi hit 99% storage.

I'm staring at the screen, about to open browser tabs and Google "linux check disk usage by folder" - you know, the usual Sunday debugging flow.

Then I thought, "Wait, doesn't Warp have AI?"

So I just asked it: "What's using all my disk space?"

It didn't just give me the command. It generated the diagnostic steps, explained what each one does, showed me how to clean it up, AND suggested how to prevent it from happening again.

All in the terminal. No context switching. No Stack Overflow tabs.

And I'd been ignoring this for weeks.

Me. The AI tools guy.

Sometimes the most useful features are the ones hiding in plain sight - especially when you're so used to doing things the old way that you forget to look.

What AI feature have you been ignoring in your daily tools?
