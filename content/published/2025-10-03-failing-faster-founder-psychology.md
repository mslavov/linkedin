I've been avoiding failure. Which means I'm failing.

A friend called me out yesterday. After watching me obsess over AgentForge's infrastructure for two weeks, he shared a Ray Dalio video about the 5-step process for achieving goals.

His verdict? "You're not failing enough."

He's right.

I have this framework I talk about - the 40:40:20 rule:
- 40% Build (product development)
- 40% Sell (customer development)
- 20% AI Ops (building AI automations)

This week? 100% building. Zero customer contact.

The comfort trap is real. I spent two weeks building a stateless agent runner, a Nango integration plugin, team management, billing systems. Beautiful infrastructure. Zero customer conversations.

I know what needs to be done - get Bugzy in front of QA teams, collect feedback, iterate. Instead, I'm doing what I'm good at. What I enjoy. What feels productive.

But building in isolation isn't productive. It's procrastination with prettier commits.

So here's my uncomfortable plan for next week:

Monday: Follow-ups with the folks who actually have the problem I'm solving. Plus some creative customer hunting (yes, I'm actually considering applying to QA positions just to get in the room with potential users).

Tuesday: "Architecting AI Native Organisations: Skills, Mindset, Models" event. No hiding behind technical talks. I'm going to have actual customer conversations.

The irony? I built AgentForge to help others ship faster. Meanwhile, I'm the one who needs to ship - not code, but customer learnings.

Ray Dalio's process starts with goals, encounters problems, diagnoses root causes, designs solutions, then executes. I skipped straight to execution. On the wrong thing.

Time to fail faster. Starting Monday.

What's the thing you avoid doing that you know would actually move your startup forward?
