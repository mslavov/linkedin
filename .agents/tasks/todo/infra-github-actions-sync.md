# Create GitHub Action for Nightly Notion Sync

## Context
- PRD: [Initial PRD](../../../docs/product/initial-prd.md)
- Architecture: [LinkedIn Automation Architecture](../../../scratch/linkedin-automation-architecture.md)
- Related Tasks: Automated daily sync from Notion to GitHub

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create .github/workflows/notion-sync.yml workflow file
- [ ] Configure nightly schedule (cron expression)
- [ ] Set up Claude Code CLI in GitHub Actions environment
- [ ] Configure secure access to Notion API credentials
- [ ] Implement sync execution with error handling
- [ ] Add commit and push logic for synced files
- [ ] Set up notifications for sync failures
- [ ] Create manual trigger option for testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Workflow runs automatically every night at specified time
- [ ] Claude Code CLI executes /sync-notion command successfully
- [ ] New ideas are committed and pushed to repository
- [ ] Workflow can be manually triggered for testing
- [ ] Failures send notifications to appropriate channels
- [ ] Sync status is logged and accessible
- [ ] No sensitive credentials exposed in logs

## Technical Notes
- Use UTC time for cron schedule consistency
- Consider time zones for optimal sync timing
- Use GitHub Actions secrets for all credentials
- Implement proper Git configuration for automated commits
- Use meaningful commit messages with sync summary
- Consider implementing sync time windows to avoid conflicts
- Add workflow status badge to README

## Testing Requirements
- Test manual workflow trigger
- Verify cron schedule executes correctly
- Test with both empty and populated Notion database
- Verify error handling and notifications
- Ensure commits have proper attribution
- Test credential security (no leaks in logs)
