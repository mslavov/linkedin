💯 true! … so true …

In this post I agreed enthusiastically with a fellow CTO, **Benji Weber**, and reshared his insights about how coding practices that make software easier for humans also benefit AI coding assistants.  My comment was brief – I simply wrote “so true” to signal my agreement.

Benji Weber (Co‑founder & CTO at AI Innovation & Governance Lab)

### Content

Benji wrote that many of the same things that make software easier for people to work with also make it easier for large‑language‑model coding agents:

- **Small steps** – making incremental changes rather than massive rewrites.
- **Smaller, simpler codebases** with less context to keep in your head.
- **Fast feedback** via tests and other checks that quickly disqualify changes that break important functionality.

He argued that adopting such practices benefits both human developers and AI tools.
