Monday morning. Three pilots running. Six qualified leads. Thirty cold leads in the pipeline.

And I'm breaking my 40:40:20 rule this week.

For those who haven't followed along: I split time 40% build, 40% sell, 20% AI ops. It's the framework that keeps me honest about talking to customers instead of hiding in my IDE.

But this Monday? I'm betting 80% of my time on one thing: making Bugzy's QA agent actually good at its job.

Here's my 5:30 AM coffee reality check:

**The Pipeline Question**: Do I need more leads? 3 pilots + 3 qualified + 6 interested + 30+ cold. Honest answer? Not really. I need the agent to be amazing for the people already interested.

**The Product Question**: Do I need to fix those bugs on the homepage (yes, I know they're there ðŸ˜…)? Maybe. But if the core agent can't think like a senior QA engineer, those pretty lists don't matter.

**The Bottleneck**: Agent quality. If Bugzy doesn't deliver on "autonomous testing," everything else is noise.

So I'm breaking my rule this week. I'll nurture those 12 active companies. I'll fix product bugs if I have to. But the real work? Teaching an AI agent to think like someone who's spent years breaking software.

Sometimes the best frameworks are the ones you're willing to abandon when reality demands it.

What about you - do you stick to your productivity frameworks religiously, or do you break them when the situation calls for it?
