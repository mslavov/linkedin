Here's a thought experiment that's been keeping me up at night:

What if we stopped building dashboards altogether? What if users built their own?

This idea hit me while working on a personal finance MCP. I kept asking Claude to analyze my spending patterns, create reports, show trends. Each time, I'd think: "I wish I could save this view" or "This chart would be perfect on a dashboard."

Then it clicked.

**The hypothetical scenario:**
Instead of building Tableau/Looker/PowerBI clones, imagine giving users a chat interface with AI tools that can:
• "create_chart" - generates chart configs
• "add_widget" - places it on their dashboard
• "save_view" - makes it reusable
• "share_dashboard" - lets others use the template

A conversation might look like:
"Show me monthly expense trends"
"Add that to my dashboard"
"Now correlate it with income"
"Perfect, save this for my weekly review"

**Why this could be transformative:**
• No more generic dashboards that satisfy nobody
• Users build exactly what they need, when they need it
• Dashboards evolve with changing requirements
• Sharing becomes about templates, not static views

This connects to my recent Claude Code discoveries – letting AI build incrementally based on actual needs rather than imagined requirements. Same principle, different domain.

**The technical approach I'm imagining:** 
AI agents with tools that return structured data for charting libraries. Users compose interfaces through conversation. The "UI" becomes emergent from their actual workflows.

After years of building analytics platforms that required constant feature requests and compromises, this vision of user-built interfaces feels like the future.

What if every interface was just a conversation away from being exactly what you need? Would you trust AI to build your dashboards?
