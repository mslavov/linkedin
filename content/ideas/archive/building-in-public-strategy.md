## Original Prompt
What should I write about? This week was "unstructured". I started working on my own AI agent orchestrator platform, but more on that later. Then I annouced I'm going all-in on Bugzy, building in public. And while coding and having meetings with people trying to convice them how cool Bugzy is, again more on that later. I started wondering, how do I build in public. What should I share? Should a post a poll, to see, or just post about everything and see what people like? Currently I think I will split it according to how I split my time, like product updates, sales updates, and AI automation updates. Yeah, what's happening more or less, I guess. What do you think?

## Core Idea
The authentic struggle of figuring out what to share when building in public - should I ask the audience, experiment with everything, or create a structured content strategy based on how I actually spend my time?

## Key Points
- The unstructured reality of early-stage startup work (AI orchestrator platform, Bugzy development, customer meetings)
- Going all-in on Bugzy announcement already made
- The meta challenge: How to build in public when you're not sure what people want to see
- Three-pillar content strategy idea: product updates, sales/customer updates, AI automation insights
- The tension between structured content planning vs authentic sharing

## Potential Hook
"I announced I'm building Bugzy in public. Then I realized... I have no idea what 'building in public' actually means for me. Should I poll you? Share everything? Here's what I'm thinking..."

OR

"This week was chaos: AI agent orchestrator experiments, Bugzy customer meetings, and a realization - I'm building in public but don't know what to share. Time to figure this out together."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Follows up on the "going all-in on Bugzy" announcement (content/published/2025-09-16-building-bugzy-in-public.md)
- Continues the authentic, vulnerable narrative style
- Meta-commentary on the process itself (similar to previous posts about using AI to fight AI slop)
- Opportunity to engage audience in shaping the content strategy

## Notes
- Consider actually including a poll in the post to engage audience
- The three-pillar approach (product/sales/AI) reflects real time allocation
- "More on that later" teases create natural hooks for follow-up content
- This vulnerability about not knowing could resonate with other builders
- Opportunity to model authentic building in public by admitting uncertainty
