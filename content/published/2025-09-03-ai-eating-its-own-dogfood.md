Everyone's raging about "AI slop" flooding LinkedIn in 2025. Generic posts pretending to be human. Soulless content farms. The death of authentic professional discourse.

Here's the plot twist: I built an AI system to create LinkedIn posts â€“ and it's the exact opposite of slop. ðŸš€

The difference? AI slop replaces human voice. My system amplifies it.

For two years, I'd brain dump ideas, then spend 30 minutes per post wrestling with ChatGPT rewrites and copy-paste gymnastics. 78 hours annually of mind-numbing formatting. My authentic thoughts were there â€“ just trapped behind tedious workflow friction.

So I did something wonderfully meta: used Claude Code to build a system that uses AI to create LinkedIn posts about using AI. Built it in 4 hours. No code written by hand â€“ just conversations with an AI assistant.

The workflow preserves MY voice at every step:
â€¢ GitHub Issues: Raw, unfiltered thoughts straight from my brain
â€¢ Claude loads my tone guidelines, post history, personal facts
â€¢ Maintains narrative continuity across my VMwareâ†’Startupâ†’CTO journey
â€¢ PR review: I verify it sounds like me, not a motivational bot
â€¢ Manual publishing: Final human control

Results after two weeks:
â€¢ Time per post: 30min â†’ 3min (90% reduction)
â€¢ Published: 8 posts with consistent cadence
â€¢ Pipeline: Always have 4-5 posts ready to go
â€¢ Voice consistency: Still playful, still transparent about the messy parts

Here's what makes this NOT slop:
1. Starts with MY specific thoughts, not generic prompts
2. Trained on MY writing history and voice patterns
3. References MY actual professional journey
4. I review and approve every word before publishing

The irony? This post defending AI-generated content was created through this exact system. It started as my genuine frustration with the AI slop debate, passed through my AI amplifier, and landed here â€“ still unmistakably me.

Open source if you want to build your own voice amplifier: https://github.com/mslavov/linkedin

So here's my spicy take: The problem isn't AI creating content. It's people using AI to create content they never had in the first place. When you have authentic thoughts but struggle with the mechanics of sharing them, AI becomes a megaphone, not a mouthpiece.

What's your line between AI assistance and AI replacement? Where does amplification end and slop begin?
