I was creating libraries with Claude Code almost daily. And almost daily, I was disappointed.

The pattern was becoming predictable: create detailed plan → review architecture → implement everything → realize I'd never actually use this code. 

Sound familiar?

Yesterday, frustrated after yet another "perfect" library I'd never touch again, I had a wild idea. Claude Code can read files, right? So I asked it to analyze my chat history (sitting right there in ~/.claude).

What it found stopped me cold.

My successful projects all had one thing in common: they started small. Really small. The failures? They all began with comprehensive planning sessions.

I'd unconsciously abandoned a practice that worked perfectly in Cursor – constant validation through smaller iterations. Somehow, with more powerful AI, I'd convinced myself I needed to plan MORE, not less.

The insight hit like a compile error at 5 PM on Friday:

**Old workflow:** Plan everything → Full implementation → Disappointment → Delete  
**What actually works:** Sketch → Prototype → Validate → Iterate

Here's what I'm changing (haven't tried it yet, but my gut says this is it):

• Start with usage examples, not architecture diagrams  
• Write the code I wish existed before building it  
• Developer experience before implementation elegance  
• If it doesn't feel right after 10 minutes, pivot immediately  

The meta part? An AI tool analyzing its own conversations to help me use it better. We're living in interesting times.

The same principles that make code maintainable for humans (small steps, simple context, fast feedback) apply to working WITH AI tools too. I've been learning this the hard way.

Sometimes the best workflow improvements come from admitting what isn't working, even when using the most advanced tools available.

What patterns have you discovered in your own AI-assisted development workflow?
