I keep seeing job posts from betting companies looking for QA help. Good money. Complex systems. Exactly what Bugzy should be perfect for.

I scroll past every single one.

Not because I'm judging their business. Someone will help them, and that's fine. But I've realized something: I want to work with people who share my values.

The practical voice in my head says this is stupid. "You're bootstrapping. You need revenue. Cast the widest net."

But here's what I keep coming back to: The best working relationships I've had weren't just transactional.

Take Cloud Office, where I'm a customer. It feels completely different working with people whose first priority is solving your problem, not extracting your money. That honest, open relationship? That's what I want to build from the other side.

So yeah, I'm being picky. Healthcare platforms that need reliability. Developer tools that need polish. Education tech that actually has to work. Companies where better QA means something more than optimizing user retention metrics.

Maybe in six months I'll regret this. Maybe I'll be desperate enough to work with anyone who'll pay.

But right now, while I still have the freedom to choose, I'm choosing to build relationships with people who care about the same things I do.

Is this naive? Probably. But I'd rather start with values and adjust than start without them and try to add them later.

What's your take â€“ does choosing customers based on shared values make sense, or am I just making it harder on myself?
