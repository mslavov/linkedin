[PLACEHOLDER - Update when agenda releases]

The first AI Engineer conference is landing in Paris (Sept 23-24), and I'll be there soaking up everything I can before diving full-time into building Bugzy.

Station F, 700+ AI engineers, single-track technical talks, and hopefully less hype, more substance. After years of "AI will change everything" keynotes, I'm ready for the "here's how we actually built this" conversations.

**What I'm most excited about:**
â€¢ Real implementation stories from the trenches
â€¢ The expo floor (always where the best conversations happen)
â€¢ Meeting builders who've moved beyond ChatGPT wrappers
â€¢ Finding my tribe of AI-assisted solo founders

If you're going, let's connect! I'll be the one asking annoyingly specific questions about context windows and token optimization. â˜•

Planning to attend? What are you hoping to learn?

And if you're presenting â€“ absolutely want to catch your talk. Drop a comment so I don't miss it.

See you at Station F! ðŸš€
