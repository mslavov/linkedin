I announced that I was starting a new position as **Chief Technology Officer at TOKI!**  After working on my previous startup **Lofty** for six months we decided it wasn’t the right time for that product.  I learned a lot during that period and am now excited to focus on clean energy and the challenges of the energy transition.  I thanked everyone who supported us and invited them to follow our journey.
