# Placeholder Post - To Be Written

## Topic: Open Source/Community Contribution (Pillar 4 - Community & Education)

### Potential angles to explore:
- New MCP server created for Bugzy or personal use
- Contribution to existing Claude Code/MCP ecosystem
- Tool or utility shared with the community
- Educational content: "How to build X with Claude Code"
- Collaboration story from the AI Engineer conference
- Fork and improvement of existing tool (like the Slack MCP)

### Specific ideas:
- Bugzy MCP server - making QA accessible to everyone
- Claude Code workflow/template for specific use case
- Documentation contribution to help others
- Bug fix or feature addition to community tool
- Sharing a particularly useful prompt or pattern

### Connection points:
- Reference "build what you need" philosophy from Slack MCP post
- Show how community feedback shapes Bugzy
- Demonstrate "learning in public" approach
- Connect to relationships built at conference

### Tone guidelines:
- Generous with knowledge sharing
- Include actual code/implementation details
- Make it actionable for readers
- Encourage others to contribute/fork/improve
