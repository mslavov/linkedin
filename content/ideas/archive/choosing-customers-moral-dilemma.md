## Original Prompt
I want to talk about the moral dilemma I face with business customers. Who should I work with? Should I be picky from the beginning, set the rules up front, and be open about it?

One controversial area is betting companies. They do need QA, but I don't believe they add moral value to the world. The entertainment of some people shouldn't come at the expense of others' addiction. That's my point of view, and I don't want to impose it on anyone.

Now that I'm a business owner, should I pursue this, or should I be selective about who I work with? Of course, I won't be… I mean, if I build a self‑service product, I probably won't decline or verify the business type. I'm not sure.

For now, I've decided not to target companies that I don't believe add significant value to society.

## Core Idea
As a business owner building Bugzy (autonomous QA platform), facing the tension between business growth and personal values. Should I be selective about customers from day one? How do I reconcile the need for revenue with the desire to work with companies that add genuine value to society?

## Key Points
- Betting/gambling companies need QA services too, but raise ethical concerns about profiting from addiction
- Self-service products make it harder to enforce customer selection criteria
- Early-stage startups face pressure to take any paying customer
- The difference between imposing values vs. living by them in business decisions
- The practical trade-off: targeting specific industries vs. casting a wide net

## Potential Hook
"Just turned down a potential customer. Not because they couldn't pay. Not because they were difficult. Because I couldn't look myself in the mirror if I helped them grow."

Alternative: "Every founder faces this: Do you work with anyone who'll pay, or do you get picky from day one?"

## Connection to Previous Content
- Relates to the 40:40:20 rule (40% Sell) - but this adds nuance: not all selling is equal
- Connects to authentic voice and transparency in building in public
- Touches on the startup journey theme of making hard decisions
- Could reference the dual CTO role and learning what "value" means at NEG.BG vs IncentivAI

## Notes
- This is a vulnerable topic that many founders face but few discuss publicly
- Could spark interesting debate without being preachy
- Need to be careful not to sound judgmental of others' choices
- The uncertainty ("I'm not sure") is authentic and relatable
- Self-service product angle adds practical complexity
- Frame as personal journey, not prescriptive advice
- Consider the "building in public" angle: sharing the dilemma, not the answer
- Could reference specific industries without naming companies: betting, crypto/Web3 hype, surveillance tech, etc.
- The tension between pragmatism (need revenue) and idealism (want impact) is very founder-relatable

## Additional Context (2025-10-04)
- **Real situation**: I actually see job posts from betting companies - that's how I know about them
- **My decision**: I've decided not to contact them in any way and be picky about who I work with
- **Core value**: I love working with people who I share common values with
- **Example: Cloud Office**: Although being their customer, it feels great to have an honest and open working relationship with people whose first priority is to solve your problem and not get your money
- **Key insight**: This is about choosing to work with people who share values, not just avoiding certain industries
- **Important**: Don't make up fake facts - the dilemma is theoretical (seeing job posts), not a real customer situation that happened
