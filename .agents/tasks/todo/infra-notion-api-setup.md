# Set Up Notion API Integration

## Context
- PRD: [Initial PRD](../../../docs/product/initial-prd.md)
- Architecture: [LinkedIn Automation Architecture](../../../scratch/linkedin-automation-architecture.md)
- Related Tasks: Notion database sync functionality

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create Notion integration and obtain API key
- [ ] Document Notion database structure requirements
- [ ] Create Node.js/Python client for Notion API interaction
- [ ] Implement authentication and secure credential storage
- [ ] Build query functions for fetching unsynced ideas
- [ ] Create update functions to mark ideas as synced
- [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Write comprehensive API documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Notion API key is securely stored in GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Can successfully query the ideas database
- [ ] Can fetch all unsynced items with required fields
- [ ] Can update sync status on Notion items
- [ ] API calls handle rate limiting gracefully
- [ ] All functions have proper error handling
- [ ] Integration is documented with usage examples

## Technical Notes
- Use official Notion SDK (@notionhq/client for Node.js)
- Store API key in GitHub Secrets, never commit to repository
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limit handling
- Database must have 'synced' checkbox and 'last_synced' timestamp fields
- Consider pagination for large datasets
- Use environment variables for all configuration

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all API wrapper functions
- Integration tests with test Notion database
- Test rate limit handling with rapid requests
- Verify credential security (no keys in logs)
- Test error scenarios (network failures, invalid responses)
