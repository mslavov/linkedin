## Original Prompt
I was supposed to have a vacation, but I worked ... how do you handle vacations when you are solo?

## Core Idea
The reality of being a solo founder is that "vacation" becomes a theoretical concept. You're supposed to disconnect, but the product is your responsibility, customers don't pause, and competitors don't either. This post explores the honest truth about vacation attempts as a solo founder and opens a discussion about how others handle this impossible balance.

## Key Points
- The expectation vs. reality of taking time off as a solo founder
- Why "just disconnect" advice doesn't work when you're the only one
- The guilt cycle: feeling like you should relax but can't stop thinking about the product
- Different approaches: micro-breaks vs. full disconnects vs. "working vacations"
- The question nobody asks: Is it even possible to truly vacation solo, or do you need a co-founder/team first?

## Potential Hook
"I blocked off a week for vacation. Day 1: I'm checking Slack. Day 2: Quick customer call. Day 3: Just one bug fix. By Day 4, I'd given up pretending."

or

"My calendar said 'VACATION - DO NOT DISTURB.' My brain said 'But what if that customer emails back?'"

## Connection to Previous Content
Connects to the 40:40:20 framework - where does vacation fit when you're supposed to be splitting time between Build, Sell, and AI Ops? This is the hidden cost of solo founding that nobody talks about. References your early riser habits and work-life boundaries from memory.md - the tension between having boundaries and being solely responsible.

## Notes
- This is relatable to both audiences: fellow founders will nod along, potential customers see the dedication
- Avoid making it a complaint - frame it as an honest exploration
- Could share specific tactics that have/haven't worked
- Might resonate with the early-bird schedule - do you work during "vacation" mornings and take afternoons off?
- Consider the irony: you have strong work-life boundaries (early to bed) but can you actually take a full day off?
- This could open up discussion about when a solo founder knows it's time to hire or find a co-founder
