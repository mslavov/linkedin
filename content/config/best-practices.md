# Guide to LinkedIn Content for Solo Founders Building in Public

**Solo founders who build in public** have a unique opportunity on LinkedIn: by sharing their startup journey transparently, they can engage *two key audiences* at once ‚Äì potential customers and fellow founders. This guide will help you craft LinkedIn content that resonates with both groups. We‚Äôll draw on analyses of top-performing posts, proven writing best practices (including keeping your writing authentic and ‚Äúweird‚Äù in the age of AI), concrete post templates, and tips on hooks, storytelling, and consistency. Use the clear sections and examples below as a practical playbook for your own LinkedIn journey.

## Engaging Two Audiences: Customers and Fellow Founders

Building in public means **sharing real-time updates** on your startup‚Äôs progress, which naturally attracts different readers:

| **Audience**           | **What They Look For in Your Posts**                                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Potential Customers** | ‚Ä¢ Updates that show how your product is evolving to solve their problems. <br> ‚Ä¢ Proof of traction or credibility (milestones, user numbers) ‚Äì builds trust. <br> ‚Ä¢ Insights or tips related to your industry or solution (demonstrating expertise). <br> ‚Ä¢ Assurance that you listen to feedback and are committed to delivering value. |
| **Fellow Founders**    | ‚Ä¢ Honest accounts of the startup journey ‚Äì both wins and struggles (so they know they‚Äôre not alone). <br> ‚Ä¢ Lessons learned from failures, challenges, and successes that they can apply to their own ventures. <br> ‚Ä¢ Behind-the-scenes stories about building a business (process, tactics, mindset). <br> ‚Ä¢ A sense of community ‚Äì engaging them in discussion or asking for their experiences/advice. |

**Great LinkedIn content strikes a balance:** for example, a post about *launching a new feature* can reassure customers that you‚Äôre improving the product for them, while also sharing the story of how you built it (which fellow founders find insightful). Keep both audiences in mind as you plan your posts, aiming to provide **value (for customers)** and **authentic storytelling (for founders)** in each update.

## Lessons from Top ‚ÄúBuild in Public‚Äù LinkedIn Posts

What exactly makes some LinkedIn posts from solo founders *take off*? Let‚Äôs break down the common traits of **top-performing posts** by founders who build in public, and why they work so well:

### 1. Authentic Tone and Personal Voice

Successful founder posts feel genuine and human. They use a **conversational tone** ‚Äì as if speaking to a peer ‚Äì rather than formal corporate-speak. Top founders are not afraid to sound like themselves, even if that means being a bit quirky or ‚Äúweird.‚Äù In fact, having an *idiosyncratic voice* helps posts stand out in a sea of bland, AI‚Äëpolished content. Authenticity also means **transparency about the journey**. High‚Äëperforming posts often share not just the wins, but also the struggles or doubts. This vulnerability in tone makes you relatable and trustworthy.

### 2. Storytelling Beats Corporate Data Dumps

A standout trait of great LinkedIn posts is **storytelling**. Rather than just sharing a statistic or a product pitch up front, successful founders *lead with a narrative*. Only after hooking the reader do they introduce supporting data or insights, then conclude with a punchy lesson or takeaway.  

**‚ÄúStory Sandwich‚Äù** structure:  

1. **Hook with an emotional story**  
2. **Support with relevant data or details**  
3. **Close with a takeaway or insight**  

### 3. A Bit of Controversy (Defensible Stance) Sparks Engagement

Many top‚Äëperforming posts have a perspective that isn‚Äôt just the same old advice. Solo founders who *‚Äúcrush it‚Äù* on LinkedIn often **take a clear stand or share a contrarian opinion** that challenges conventional wisdom. If you have a viewpoint that differs from the norm, share it along with reasoning or evidence.

### 4. Visuals and Format: Carousels, Images, and More

On LinkedIn, the format of your post can significantly impact reach and engagement. High‚Äëperforming posts often leverage **visual content or engaging formats** rather than plain text walls. Practical ways to add visual interest include:

* Sharing charts or screenshots  
* Creating a simple carousel  
* Posting photos or short video clips  

### 5. Inviting Engagement (Without "Engagement Bait")

Top LinkedIn posts by founders don't just broadcast updates; they **spark conversations**. End the post with a genuine question or prompt that encourages others to weigh in. Avoid cheap engagement‚Äëbait phrases like "Comment 'Yes' if you agree!"

**Single CTA Best Practice**: Use just one focused question at the end of your post. Avoid splitting questions by audience type (e.g., "Developers: X? Founders: Y?"). Instead, craft an inclusive question that both audiences can answer from their perspective. This creates a more unified conversation thread and avoids making your post feel fragmented.

### 6. Consistent Presence and Smart Frequency

Top LinkedIn founders are **consistent** in showing up, but not in a spammy way. Establish a **posting cadence you can sustain** (e.g., 2‚Äë3 posts per week) and stick to your **content pillars** so followers know what value they‚Äôll get.

## Writing Best Practices: Authentic, Clear, and Engaging

### Keep It Real (Authenticity > Perfection)

Authenticity is your superpower. Write like a human, not a press release. Use your own colloquialisms, admit mistakes, and keep some "weirdness" in your prose so it doesn't sound like generic AI copy.

### Optimal Post Length: The Sweet Spot

While LinkedIn allows up to 3,000 characters, the most effective posts typically range from **1,200-1,500 characters**. This length:

* Provides enough depth to tell a complete story
* Avoids the "wall of text" feeling that makes readers scroll past
* Respects your audience's time and attention
* Forces you to be concise and impactful

**Critical**: The first 210 characters are what show in the feed before "See more" - make sure your hook completes a thought or creates intrigue before this cutoff.

### Clarity and Brevity Win

* Front‚Äëload important info  
* Use simple language and short paragraphs  
* Lists and whitespace improve readability  
* Strong closing line summarises the takeaway  

### Originality in the Age of AI

With AI tools everywhere, a lot of content starts to sound formulaic. Share your unique experiences, use vivid details or metaphors, and offer fresh takes. Preserve character without sacrificing clarity.

### Engage Like It's a Conversation

Use "you" and "we," ask questions, show emotion appropriately, and encourage responses genuinely.

## How to Structure Posts: Hooks, Narrative Flow, and Consistency

* **Hooks:** Be specific, intriguing, and short. Numbers, questions, or bold statements work well. Ensure your hook completes a thought within the first 210 characters.
* **Narrative Flow:** Follow through on the hook, use logical structure, keep paragraphs tight, and use line breaks for rhythm.  
* **Consistency:** Maintain a sustainable cadence (3‚Äë5 posts a week is common) and stick to your themes and voice.
* **Next Post Teasers:** When referencing upcoming content, keep it vague (e.g., "Coming up next..." or "In a future post..."). Avoid specific timing commitments like "tomorrow" or exact dates - this maintains flexibility in your content schedule and prevents disappointing readers if plans change.
* **Avoid Explicit References to Previous Posts:** Don't start posts with "Remember my previous post about..." or make direct references to specific earlier posts. Each post should stand on its own without requiring readers to have seen your previous content. This ensures new followers aren't excluded and maintains accessibility.

## Standing Out on LinkedIn

* **Optimal Cadence:** Quality > quantity. Experiment but aim for steady posting over 90‚Äëday stretches.  
* **Engage with Community:** Respond to comments, comment on others‚Äô posts, and stay positive.  
* **Protect Your Voice:** Lean into your uniqueness, edit AI output heavily, and evolve your tone as you grow.

## Final Thought

Building an influential LinkedIn presence as a solo founder takes time, experimentation, and genuine engagement. Provide value, be authentic, tell good stories, and interact with people. Over months, these consistent efforts compound into tangible growth for both your network and your startup.

*Happy building (and posting) in public! üöÄ*
