## Core Idea
Running an entire business as code in GitHub, using Claude Code to handle everything from product planning to marketing, sales, finances, and legal operations.

## Key Points
- Already automated LinkedIn posting with GitHub repo + Claude Code
- Want to expand this approach to entire business operations
- Keep it private (not open source) due to customer information
- Fulfill the promise of "using AI to run my business"

## Potential Hook
"I keep saying I'll use AI to run my business. Time to actually do it - by turning my entire business into code."

## Connection to Previous Content
- Builds on successful LinkedIn automation project
- Natural evolution from automating one aspect to entire business
- Continues the "building in public" narrative but with privacy considerations

## Notes
- Need to consider data privacy and security implications
- Could be a multi-part series showing different aspects being automated
- Real-world example of AI-first business operations
- Address the balance between automation and human oversight
