# Create End-to-End Test Suite

## Context
- PRD: [Initial PRD](../../../docs/product/initial-prd.md)
- Architecture: [LinkedIn Automation Architecture](../../../scratch/linkedin-automation-architecture.md)
- Related Tasks: Comprehensive testing of the entire workflow

## Subtasks
- [ ] Set up test environment with mock services
- [ ] Create Notion API mock for testing
- [ ] Create LinkedIn API mock for testing
- [ ] Write tests for complete sync workflow
- [ ] Write tests for content generation pipeline
- [ ] Write tests for PR creation and merge flow
- [ ] Write tests for publishing workflow
- [ ] Write tests for queue management
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Create test data generators

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full workflow can be tested without external APIs
- [ ] All happy paths are covered
- [ ] Common error scenarios are tested
- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are tracked
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 80%
- [ ] Tests are maintainable and documented
- [ ] Mock data is realistic

## Technical Notes
- Use appropriate testing framework for language
- Implement proper test isolation
- Use dependency injection for mocking
- Create reusable test fixtures
- Consider contract testing for APIs
- Implement test parallelization
- Add visual regression tests for PRs

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for workflows
- End-to-end tests for full pipeline
- Performance tests for scale
- Security tests for credentials
- Accessibility tests for UI components
- Load tests for API endpoints
