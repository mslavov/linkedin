I stumbled upon a TED demo where neuroscientist **Greg Gage** uses electrodes to let one person control another person’s arm with their brain signals.  It’s super cool to see how brain–machine interfaces can teach people about neuroscience.  The demo highlights the potential of technology to connect our bodies and machines in surprising ways.

In this live demonstration, Greg Gage shows how simple devices can measure and transmit nerve signals from one person to another.  By connecting electrodes to volunteers, he enables one person’s brain signals to control another person’s arm.  The talk serves as an accessible introduction to neuroscience and brain–computer interfaces.
