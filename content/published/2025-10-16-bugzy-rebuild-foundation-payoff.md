Two weeks of "wasted" work. Two days of execution. 16,185 lines of code.

The fastest rebuild of my startup came from building the wrong thing first.

Here's why.

For about two weeks before the pivot, I'd been building what looked like the wrong thing - a generic AI agent orchestration platform. When I should have been building Bugzy.

I kept asking myself, "Why am I building infrastructure when I should be shipping features?"

Fair question. It felt unfocused. It felt like avoiding the real work.

Then last week happened.

I sat down with Claude Code and created a 1,600-line plan to port everything from the generic platform to Bugzy. Two days later, I'd executed that plan.

Platform migration. Slack integration. Invite-only auth. Environment variable management. Security hardening. Agent execution runtime. Git-based file system.

All of it already existed. I just had to make it Bugzy-specific instead of generic.

That "wasteful" foundation work? It became my biggest asset.

16,185 net lines in one week because the foundation was already there. Not building from scratch - reusing, adapting, porting.

The real timeline looked like this:
- 5 weeks ago: Started building generic orchestration platform (seemed wrong)
- 3 weeks ago: Decided to pivot implementation approach (finally got clarity)
- Last week Tuesday: Created the detailed migration plan (2 hours)
- Wednesday & Thursday: Executed the rebuild (2 days full-time)
- Friday: Shipping the transformed product

The pivot decision was three weeks ago. But I couldn't have executed it without those weeks of "unfocused" foundation work.

This is the part of startup building nobody talks about. Sometimes you need to build your own tools before you can build your product. Sometimes the "wrong thing" is actually the necessary foundation for the right thing.

The cycle looked wasteful: generic platform → unclear direction → weeks of infrastructure → finally pivot to product.

But without that cycle, the rebuild would have taken weeks instead of days.

I'm not saying this was the optimal path. Maybe I should have built Bugzy-specific from day one. Maybe I wasted time on abstractions I didn't need.

But I also shipped 16,185 lines of production-ready code in one week because I had components ready to assemble.

The lesson? Sometimes "wasteful" work isn't waste. Sometimes you're building the foundation you'll need when the right moment comes.

The trick is knowing the difference between necessary foundation and actual procrastination.

I'm still figuring that out.

Have you ever built something that felt like the wrong thing, only to realize it was exactly what you needed later?
