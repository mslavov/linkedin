Remember when I said "more on that later" about what I'm building next?

Well, it's later.

I'm going all-in on Bugzy.ai. Full time. And I've decided to build it completely in public, sharing the messy reality of going from zero toâ€¦ well, we'll see where this goes.

Why build in public? Three reasons, in order of honesty:

1. It might actually be useful to people in my network. We're all figuring out this AI thing together, and maybe my experiments will save someone else a headache or two.

2. Building a company solo gets lonely. Really lonely. Sharing the journey means I won't be talking to my rubber duck debugger quite as much. (Though let's be real, I'll still be doing that too.)

3. Who knows, it might turn out to be good content marketing. ðŸ¤· 
(Look at me, one post in and already thinking like a tech influencer. Next thing you know I'll be posting motivational quotes over sunset photos.)

Here's the wild part: I'm doing everything with AI. And I mean everything. Coding, product design, selling, marketing, admin, ops â€“ it's me and the machines all the way down. Remember those "1 person billion dollar company" predictions? Yeah, I'm not quite that optimistic, but let's see how far one person with really good AI workflows can go.

My current plan (which, knowing me, will change by next Tuesday):
- 40% building product (two days a week of actual coding)
- 40% talking to customers and learning how to sell (turns out engineers need to eat)
- 20% building AI agents and workflows (starting with coding workflows that actually work)

The irony isn't lost on me that after years of building engineering teams, I'm now building a team of AI agents instead. Though I have to say, they complain less about stand-up meetings.

So here we go. From CTO managing teams to solo founder managing prompts. From planning sprints to changing plans weekly. From knowing what I'm doing toâ€¦ whatever this is going to be.

Want to watch someone figure out if you can actually build a real business with AI as your primary collaborator? You're in the right place.

The experiment starts now.

What's the one thing you'd want AI to handle in your business that it absolutely can't do well yet?
