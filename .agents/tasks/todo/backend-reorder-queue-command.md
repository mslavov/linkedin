# Implement /reorder-queue Slash Command

## Context
- PRD: [Initial PRD](../../../docs/product/initial-prd.md)
- Architecture: [LinkedIn Automation Architecture](../../../scratch/linkedin-automation-architecture.md)
- Related Tasks: Intelligent queue management for approved posts

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create slash command structure for /reorder-queue
- [ ] Analyze all posts in /approved directory
- [ ] Implement content similarity detection algorithm
- [ ] Create urgency scoring based on content analysis
- [ ] Detect time-sensitive vs evergreen content
- [ ] Build reordering algorithm considering multiple factors
- [ ] Implement queue visualization
- [ ] Allow manual override options
- [ ] Update file names/metadata to reflect new order
- [ ] Generate reordering report with rationale

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Command analyzes all approved posts effectively
- [ ] Similar posts are spaced apart in the queue
- [ ] Time-sensitive content is prioritized appropriately
- [ ] Reordering rationale is clear and logical
- [ ] Manual overrides are supported
- [ ] Queue state is easily visualizable
- [ ] Changes can be reverted if needed
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for large queues

## Technical Notes
- Use NLP for content similarity detection
- Consider multiple factors: recency, relevance, diversity
- Implement scoring algorithm with adjustable weights
- Use semantic analysis for topic clustering
- Consider audience fatigue from similar topics
- Preserve manual ordering preferences
- Make algorithm explainable and debuggable

## Testing Requirements
- Test with various queue sizes
- Verify similarity detection accuracy
- Test urgency detection for different content
- Ensure diversity in reordered queue
- Test manual override functionality
- Verify performance with large queues
- Test edge cases (empty queue, single post)
