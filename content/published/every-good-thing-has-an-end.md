All good things must come to an end.

And sometimes, that ending becomes the beginning of something even better.

After much reflection, I've made the decision to step away from my current role and chase a dream I've been carrying for too long. I'm jumping into the deep waters of building something myself. (More on that later - but trust me, it's going to be worth the wait.)

This wasn't an easy choice. Walking away from a great team and meaningful work never is. But sometimes you reach a point where the pull toward what could be becomes stronger than the comfort of what is.

I want to thank Lyuben and Line specifically - not just for the opportunity to work with them, but for their genuine support and belief in what we could accomplish together. We started something truly transformational here, both for the company and for the people on our team. That work will continue, and it will thrive.

Which brings me to an interesting opportunity: my departure creates a space for someone else to step into this engineering leadership role. If you're someone who wants to make a real impact on a huge number of people, if you're energized by the challenge of scaling teams and building products that matter - now is the time to jump in.

The foundation is solid. The vision is clear. The team is incredible.

Sometimes the best thing you can do for something you love is to make room for fresh perspective and new energy.
