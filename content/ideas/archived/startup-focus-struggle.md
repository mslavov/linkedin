## Core Idea
The struggle of maintaining focus on a single startup idea when AI has dramatically lowered the barriers to exploring and implementing multiple concepts. In the past, technical limitations forced focus - now AI enables rapid prototyping of any idea in days, creating a paradox of choice that makes commitment harder.

## Key Points
- AI has collapsed the time from idea to MVP from months to days
- The ease of exploration creates a constant temptation to chase new ideas
- Technical barriers that once forced focus no longer exist
- The real challenge has shifted from "can I build this?" to "should I keep building this?"
- Success requires new discipline strategies in an age of infinite possibilities

## Potential Hook
"I can research, design, architect, and implement a startup idea in 2 days with AI. That's not the superpower I thought it would be - it's become my biggest challenge."
